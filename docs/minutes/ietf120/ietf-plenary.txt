# IETF 120 Plenary Session

## Summary

The IETF 120 Plenary Session included reports from the IETF Chair, IAB Chair, IRTF Chair, NOMCOM Chair, IETF Trust Chair, IETF LLC Executive Director, IETF LLC Board Chair, and RFC Series Consulting Editor.  Key discussions centered around IETF 125 venue selection, moderation in IETF mailing lists, working group chair appointments, document processing transparency, travel disruptions and diversity.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IETF 125 Venue Selection:** The IESG seeks community feedback on the proposed venue in China for IETF 125. A survey was distributed to IETF attendees, closing on Saturday. The IESG will deliberate and deliver a decision to the LLC by early September.
*   **Moderation in IETF Mailing Lists:**  Increased community interest and discussion regarding moderation practices within the IETF mailing lists led to the decision to create a working group to address this topic.
*   **Working Group Chair Appointments:** The IESG is actively working to diversify the leadership pool by appointing new individuals as working group chairs, often using a "one plus one" approach (pairing experienced chairs with inexperienced individuals). Approximately 60% of working group chair appointments in the last year were new chairs without prior IETF chairing experience. The IESG is also aware of the issue of chairs remaining in their positions for extended periods and is considering this issue.
*   **Document Processing Transparency:** The IESG is working with the tools team to develop additional dashboards for the Datatracker to provide greater transparency into the document processing pipeline.
*   **IRTF Code of Conduct:** IRTF has developed a code of conduct focused on effective conduct of research in the IRTF. A last call for the document is expected in the coming weeks.
*   **NOMCOM Open Positions:** NOMCOM is looking to fill the following open positions:  IETF LLC board of director (1), IETF Trust (1), IAB (6), IESG (8). Nominations open soon.
*   **IETF Trust Restructuring:** The IETF Trust is undergoing restructuring, moving from a Virginia-based trust to a Delaware-based not-for-profit corporation.
*   **IETF Budget Concerns:** Questions were raised regarding the financial pressures impacting IETF participation, including increasing costs, limited funding, and corporate budgetary constraints.  There was discussion about the possibility of fewer, more intense meetings.
*   **Travel Disruption:** Discussion of travel disruptions that prevented people from attending the meeting and the impact it has on participation.
*   **Diversity:**  Concerns regarding low female participation rates in IETF meetings. A discussion was had regarding improving diversity within the community.

## Decisions and Action Items
