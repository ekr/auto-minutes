<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 22 Jul 2024 20:00</p>
<h1>mls</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The MLS Working Group meeting focused on addressing outstanding issues in the MLS architecture draft and discussing various extensions, including those related to instant messaging (Mimi) and post-quantum cryptography. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to a detailed examination of an attack involving invalid commits and external rejoins, and potential mitigations. The group also discussed several extensions, including AppSync, semi-private messages, and different credential types.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Invalid Commits and External Rejoins:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brendan presented a PR addressing vulnerabilities related to invalid commits and the external rejoin mechanism.</li>
<li>The discussion revolved around a &quot;forced rejoin attack&quot; where a malicious delivery service (DS) can manipulate group state by choosing invalid commits.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about post-compromised security (PCS) being compromised by the ability to revert to compromised epochs.</li>
<li>Various mitigations were proposed, including epoch checking, transcript verification, and public key bookkeeping.</li>
<li>The debate centered on whether the PR should only flag the risks of automated rejoin behaviors, or also include potential solutions.</li>
<li>Richard suggested focusing the architectural discussion on the risks of automated re-syncs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extensions Framework:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rowan raised an issue regarding safe extensions and AAD and a PR was submitted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AppSync Extension:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rowan presented the AppSync extension, aimed at ensuring agreement on application state within the group.</li>
<li>There was discussion around the level of MLS's involvement in defining common representations of state.</li>
<li>Raphael noted potential overlap with other extensions related to group context and extension state updates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Semi-Private Message Extension:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rowan introduced the semi-private message extension, allowing selective sharing of private message content with external receivers known to the group.</li>
<li>Raphael raised concerns about the lack of protection for the group ID.</li>
<li>Conrad and Britta supported the inclusion of this feature to the toolbox.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other Extensions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Richard presented the <code>Different Credentials</code> draft.</li>
<li>Richard presented the <code>Replaced Proposal</code> draft, allowing re-origination of updates. Concerns about potential rollbacks were raised.</li>
<li>Richard presented <code>Tree Free</code> draft, which allows client to operate with hard login guarantees instead of using the Ratchet Tree</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post-Quantum MLS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Britta provided an overview of a proposed approach for post-quantum MLS, involving two sessions (post-quantum and standard) and using exporter keys to inject post-quantum guarantees into the standard ratchet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>PR 261 (Invalid Commits/External Rejoins):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was decided to adopt a PR to address the issues of invalid commits and external rejoins.</li>
<li>A vote was held on including approaches within the PR, 4 for yes and 8 for no, and 5 for no opinions</li>
<li>Richard, Britta, Brendan, and Rowan agreed to further discuss the PR to determine appropriate text.</li>
<li>The goal is for the document to be completed during the current week.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Different Credentials Extension:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was decided that Richard should proceed with putting this directly into the current extension draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Richard, Britta, Brendan, and Rowan to collaborate and edit the PR.</li>
<li>Richard to create a PR to include the different credential drafts into the extension draft.</li>
<li>The WG to review edited PR and hopefully accept it.</li>
</ul>
