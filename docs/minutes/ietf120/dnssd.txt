## Summary

The DNSSD working group meeting at IETF 120 covered several topics including updates on working group documents, individual drafts, and discussions on SLP transport and update sizes. Key discussions revolved around multi-Q types, advertising proxy and SRP replication, Time Since Received (TSR), additional records for DNS push, and SRP performance in constrained networks. The group identified challenges and potential solutions for these areas, particularly concerning IOT scenarios and constrained network environments.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Multi-Q Types (Ray):**  Updates incorporate Peter Svedshek's text, generic response construction, and normative reference to RFC 9619. Further clarification is needed on client handling.
*   **Advertising Proxy & SRP Replication (Ted):**  Progress is stalled due to foundational work required. These are linked to thread border routers and cooperative database sharing.
*   **Time Since Received (TSR) (Ted):**  The draft focuses on asserting authority and freshness, includes a key hash for authority source, and changes the conflict resolution process. TSR info is now included in every MDNS packet using EDNS. The design aims to prevent stale data conflicts.
*   **Additional Records for DNS Push (Ted):**  Discussion centered on optimizing DNS push for constrained networks, including name compression and avoiding redundant data. Considered providing hints about known services and a TLV for SRV record address queries.
*   **SLP Transport & Update Sizes (Ted):** SRP over UDP on constrained networks experiences congestion collapse with synchronous SRP updates. Proposed solutions included six-low-pan style compression, partial HMACs, and a small initial probe message with a schedule.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Ray (Multi-Q Types):**  Publish a -03 version of the draft with the latest GitHub commits for review on the mailing list.
*   **Ted (TSR):** Discuss with lawyers about publishing the latest draft update to the IETF website. Current version is on Github.
*   **Ted:** Explore chic compression style, static context header compression, compression options with Abton.
*   **Chairs:** Investigate scheduling interim meetings.
*   **Stuart:** Rattle cages in the broader CSA organization, Thread group.
*   **Abton:** Put comments about compression and transport options into an email on the list.

## Next Steps

*   Continued discussion and code development for TSR.
*   Implementation and testing of DNS Push enhancements.
*   Further investigation into compression techniques for SRP.
*   Follow up on potential interim meeting to address SRP issues.
*   Address the audio issues for remote participants in the next meeting.
