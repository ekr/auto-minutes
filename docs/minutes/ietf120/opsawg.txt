## Summary

This opsawg meeting covered a range of topics, including updates on existing working group items, presentations of individual drafts, and a discussion about an upcoming IAB workshop on network management and operations (Nemops). The meeting also included discussions about volunteering opportunities in the IETF and a call for operators to participate in the Nemops workshop.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IPFix Exporting Delay:** The draft on exporting delay information in IPFix received positive feedback and is nearing working group last call.
*   **Data Manifest for Telemetry Data:** Updates were presented on the data manifest draft, including changes related to young module implementation and its relationship to other drafts.
*   **Packet Loss Reporting:** A draft on packet loss reporting was presented, focusing on the information model for reporting packet loss and the mapping of hardware counters to discard classes. There was discussion regarding the use of 48-bit counters and guidelines for Yang authors.
*   **IPFix Alternate Marking:** Updates were presented on the IPFix alternate marking draft, with questions raised about flow keys.
*   **TACACS+ TLS YANG Model:** Discussion on progress of modeling TechEx TLS and potential adoption of draft specifications.
*   **Data Provenance with COSE:** A proposal for using COSE signatures for data provenance was presented, with discussion regarding hosting and potential adoption in NetMod.
*   **Scheduled OAM YANG Model:** Presentation of a YANG data model for scheduled OAM, including concepts of unitary tests and test sequences. There was a discussion on schema mount approach.
*   **Intent-Based Management for SDV:** Initial presentation of intent-based management framework for software-defined vehicles. Call for discussion on mailing list.
*   **Resource Performance Monitoring YANG Model:** The YANG data model for resource performance monitoring was presented, aiming to provide uniform PM mechanisms for IP and optical domains. Discussion regarding relationship to sane architecture.
*   **IAB Nemops Workshop:** Discussion of an upcoming IAB workshop on the next era of network management operations, focusing on collecting operator requirements and recommendations for the IETF.
*   **Opportunities for Involvement in IETF:** Call for document shepherds, ops directorate members, and candidates for the ops area director.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IPFix Exporting Delay:** Chairs will initiate working group last call.
*   **Data Manifest for Telemetry Data:** Authors will remove full include and potentially include the appendix for full include.
*   **TACACS+ TLS YANG Model:** Working group to consider adoption of the draft specifications on the mailing list.
*   **Data Provenance with COSE:** Authors will prepare a demonstration for the next hackathon.

## Next Steps

*   **Data Manifest for Telemetry Data:** Authors to work on the link with the inventory.
*   **Packet Loss Reporting:** Authors will seek guidance on use of standards track naming in informational model.
*   **Scheduled OAM YANG Model:** Authors will update the draft with the schema mount approach and present it at the next IETF.
*   **Intent-Based Management for SDV:** Authors to engage in further discussions on the mailing list about the framework.
*   **Resource Performance Monitoring YANG Model:** Seek further discussions to determine best approach.
*   **IAB Nemops Workshop:** Finalize details and announce the workshop on the tracker by the end of the week. Encourage operators to participate in pre-event activities and the workshop.
