*   **ARM CCA Attestation Token (Gary):** Presented the ARM CCA attestation token architecture with delegates and direct model approaches. There was a suggestion to use the term "evidence" rather than "token" for consistency with RATS terminology.
*   **EAT Measurement Extensibility (Thomas):** Presented an extensible measurement claim for describing target environments.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **O2 Draft (Thaler):** Submit draft 03 after addressing any additional feedback.
*   **CoreM (Corrin):** Authors to provide reminders of call schedules and GitHub location on the mailing list. They will also provide more reports on the mailing list.
*   **Reference Interaction Models (Hank):** Chairs to consider directing directorate reviews and a tentative working group last call.
*   **CBOA Tag for UCCS (Carsten):** Address AD comments and resubmit the ID.
*   **Epoch Markers (Hank):** Adoption call to be placed on the mailing list.
*   **Remote Posture Assessment (Kathleen):** Confirmation of adoption status to be done on the mailing list. Implementation to be used is being incorporated, which will lead to a separate post from the mailing list.
*   **PKIX Evidence (Hannes):** Chairs to confer with LAMPS chairs to decide on adoption call. Adoption to be put to the mailing list.
*   **ARM CCA Attestation Token (Gary):** Authors to consider feedback on terminology and verifier behavior placement.
*   **EAT Measurement Extensibility (Thomas):** Adoption to be put to the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list.
