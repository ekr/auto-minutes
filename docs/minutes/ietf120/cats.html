<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 24 Jul 2024 16:30</p>
<h1>cats</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The CATS working group meeting covered several topics including use case updates, framework updates, compute modeling and metrics, and applicability to mid-haul networks. Discussions focused on refining existing documents, adding new use cases, defining metrics for computing-aware traffic steering, and addressing security concerns. A new co-chair, Med Boucadair, was announced to replace Adrian Farrel in Dublin.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Case Updates:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updates to the CATS problem statement, use cases, and requirements document were presented, including new use cases for CDN, cloud rendering, and internet vehicles.</li>
<li>Terminology changes regarding &quot;service&quot; and &quot;computing service&quot; were discussed, and consensus was reached on updated definitions.</li>
<li>Deployment testbeds in China for CDN 4K video delivery and cloud rendering were presented, along with preliminary results.</li>
<li>A use case for high-speed internet for vehicles was introduced, focusing on remote driving scenarios and the need for low latency, high bandwidth, and stable connectivity.</li>
<li>Discussion on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) use cases, focusing on context-aware navigation and cluster-based MAC protocols, with a focus on the requirements of ADAS.</li>
<li>Industrial Internet use cases were discussed, focusing on deterministic management of computing power and network resources for applications like industrial robots and virtual cloud termination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Framework Updates:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updates to the CATS framework document were presented, addressing comments from the working group adoption call and identifying areas for further development.</li>
<li>Discussion on aligning the framework with the use cases being prototyped and experimented with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Compute Modeling and Metrics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updates to the draft on computing modeling description were presented, focusing on defining computing-related metrics and how to use them in the CATS domain.</li>
<li>Design principles for metric definition were discussed, including simplicity, scalability, interoperability, stability, and accuracy.</li>
<li>A hierarchical framework for defining metrics was proposed, with three levels: raw metrics, normalized metrics, and fully normalized metrics.</li>
<li>Discussion on Kubernetes metrics and architecture.</li>
<li>A draft on CATS metric definition was introduced, proposing an initial framework for defining metrics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mid-Haul Networks Applicability:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The applicability of CATS to mid-haul networks was analyzed, focusing on the F1 interface in 3GPP terminology and the use of CATS for traffic steering between distributed units (DU) and centralized units (CU).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Kehan to welcome discussion on list.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Paul to provide suggested text for merging the ITS use case into the use case document to the authors of the use case document.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Photo to review and respond to Carlos Bernal's comment about the industrial requirements draft in the Deadnet working group via email.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Ming to add specific text to sections 3.3, 4.1, 4.5, and 5 of the framework document.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Working group members to provide feedback on the compute modeling and metrics drafts.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Chairs will talk to the AD to discuss the best way to communicate with the O-RAN Alliance.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Linda to send a note to the mailing list with a pointer to the IDR draft on the metadata past attribute.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Group to consider Security issues.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> The chairs will talk to the AD and work out what the best way to communicate with O-RAN is</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to continue refining documents based on feedback.</li>
<li>Working group to discuss and agree on default metrics for CATS.</li>
<li>Explore the interplay between the ORAN orchestration framework the SMO, and how it could interact with the CATS entities</li>
<li>Prepare new versions of drafts for the next IETF meeting.</li>
<li>Push out new revisions more often, in order to provide cleaner reading materials for the drafts.</li>
</ul>
