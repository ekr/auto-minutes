## Summary
The RIFT working group met at IETF 120 in Vancouver to discuss ongoing work and future plans. Key topics included updates on completed and in-progress deliverables, a presentation on adaptive routing, updates on the key-value store and auto-EVPN work, and discussion of the rechartering process.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Completed Deliverables:** Three initial charter deliverables are nearing completion: the base specification, the applicability statement, and the YANG model.
*   **In-Progress Deliverables:** Three working group documents are in progress and will be part of the charter: key-value structure and processing, How to Apply DAPN segment routing and multicast Srv6.
*   **Adaptive Routing (Tony):**
    *   Presented a draft on adaptive routing, addressing traffic engineering in fabrics.
    *   Discussed flooding TE metrics, southbound computation, and northbound limitations.
    *   Introduced the concept of preference-based negative disaggregation to handle partial topology information at lower levels of the fabric.
    *   Acknowledged the limitations of adaptive routing and the importance of source-specific congestion control (CAC) at L2.
    *   Discussed the traffic class abstraction and the potential for globally defined traffic classes.
    *   Addressed concerns about computational scalability and potential oscillations in adaptive routing schemes.
*   **Key Value Store Updates (Jordan):**
    *   Introduced the key subtype to provide more granularity in distinguishing between similarly structured key-value ties.
    *   Addressed normative language fixes and the use of key targets and Bloom filters.
    *   Discussed potential use cases for the key-value store, including DHCP server integration.
    *   Acknowledged concerns about the key space being too small and potential collisions.
*   **Auto-EVPN Updates (Jordan):**
    *   Renamed "MacVRF" to "EVI" to avoid confusion with EVPN terminology.
    *   Adjusted the key subtype for key-value pairs in the auto-EVPN context.
*   **Rechartering:** Discussed the proposed recharter of the working group and milestones.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Rechartering:** The working group will review the rechartering text carefully and provide feedback.
*   **Key Value Store:**
    *   Add more explanatory text for the Bloom Filter implementation in the Key Value draft.
    *   The working group will consider increasing the key space size in the future.
*   **Adaptive Routing:** Add diagrams and better explanations of concepts.

## Next Steps

*   An email will be sent to the working group to solicit feedback on the rechartering text.
*   Continue working on the drafts for Key Value, Auto-EVPN, and adaptive routing.
*   The need for an interim meeting will be assessed.
