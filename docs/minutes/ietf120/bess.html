<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 24 Jul 2024 16:30</p>
<h1>bess</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The BESS working group meeting covered working group status, including recently published RFCs and drafts in progress. Several draft presentations were given, including topics such as EVPN D-Path usage, secure EVPN with cut-through processing, updates to the EVPN base specification, seamless EVPN fabric migration, and data plane failure detection for EVPN over SRv6. Discussions centered on technical details, potential inconsistencies, and interoperability considerations. Adoption calls were also mentioned.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working Group Status:</strong> Four new RFCs published since the last IETF. Several drafts are in RFC editor's queue, AD evaluation or IESG review. The EVPN Controller for Geneva is being re-evaluated as experimental due to lack of implementations.</li>
<li><strong>EVPN D-Path:</strong> Discussion on the use of the D-Path attribute in EVPN routes for loop prevention and best path selection, inspired by inter-VPN usage. Debate centered on how D-Path interacts with best path selection and analogies to site of origin. Peter Paluch was concerned about the usage of new attribute rather than leverage layer 3 VPN mechanisms for loop detections.</li>
<li><strong>Secure EVPN with Cut-Through Processing:</strong> Proposal for a shim header to enable cut-through processing in hardware switches for ESP-protected EVPN traffic. Linda Dunbar requested this draft be shared with IPSECME working group to avoid conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>EVPN Base Specification Update:</strong> Clarifications and updates to the EVPN base specification (7432bis) were presented. Discussion regarding the treatment of untagged traffic on port-based service interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Seamless EVPN Fabric Migration:</strong> Presentation on a method for seamless migration between IPv4 and IPv6 EVPN fabrics. Sue Hears (IDR chair) questioned the adherence to RFC 9012 regarding tunneling caps, and Jorge raised concerns about the impact on DF election.</li>
<li><strong>Data Plane Failure Detection for EVPN over SRv6:</strong> Presentation of a draft defining new ICMPv6 messages for data plane failure detection in SRv6 EVPN networks. Ali Sajassi suggested leveraging existing mechanisms for base messages that define the same context.</li>
<li><strong>Multicast Leave procedure in RFC 9251:</strong> Jorge Rabadan presented a potential issue to address.</li>
<li><strong>IP Only PE draft discussion:</strong> Presentation by Dion Mishra where he discussed new updates to draft, mainly with SRI applicability and testing status from multiple vendors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>EVPN Controller for Geneva:</strong> Proceed with working group last call to reconfirm the change of status to experimental.</li>
<li><strong>EVPN interworking with IPVPN:</strong> Authors have addressed all the comments from IDR review and will move forward with publication.</li>
<li><strong>EVPN D-Path:</strong> Peter Paluch to send comments to the mailing list regarding analogies of new attribute with existing Layer 3 VPN loop detection mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Secure EVPN with Cut-Through Processing:</strong> Authors to present the draft in the IPSECME working group for feedback on key management.</li>
<li><strong>Seamless EVPN Fabric Migration:</strong> Ali Sajassi to include two key points from Jorge Huss for consideration.</li>
<li><strong>Multicast Leave procedure in RFC 9251:</strong> Authors will update based on further discussions with authors of RFC 9251.</li>
<li><strong>7432bis</strong> Move to working group last call.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Address outstanding review comments on drafts in AD evaluation and IESG review.</li>
<li>Continue discussions on the mailing list for adoption calls.</li>
<li>Schedule working group last call for drafts that are ready.</li>
<li>Ali Sajassi to follow up with Sue Hears, Jorge, Sasha Weinstein and Wan regarding their specific comments.</li>
<li>Address concerns raised regarding IETF publication of experimental implementation data.</li>
</ul>
