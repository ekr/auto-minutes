<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 23 Jul 2024 00:30</p>
<h1>ntp</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The NTP working group meeting at IETF 120 covered the status of several documents including the enterprise profile, registries document, NTS for PTP, NTP over PTP, NTPV5 requirements, NTPV5 specifics, and Rough Time.  Discussions included addressing IESG comments, coordinating with the 1588 community, and planning hackathon projects.  The group emphasized the need for more reviews on the documents.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enterprise Profile:</strong>  Addressing last call balloting comments from the IESG before moving to the RFC editor.</li>
<li><strong>Registries Document:</strong> Working on resolving IESG ballot comments with updated text expected this week.</li>
<li><strong>NTS for PTP:</strong>  Officially adopted by the working group. Security concerns were addressed as not being a blocking issue.</li>
<li><strong>NTP over PTP:</strong> Addressed concerns from the 1588 community and updated the draft accordingly.  Ready to send to the IESG pending a shepherd write-up.</li>
<li><strong>Interleave Mode:</strong>  Returning to the IETF telechat on August 22nd.  Needs additional balloting and reviews.</li>
<li><strong>NTPV5 Requirements Draft:</strong> Needs additional changes and editorial support. Discussed whether to publish the document, deciding to develop it further before making a decision.</li>
<li><strong>NTPV5 Specifics Draft:</strong> Updated draft includes replacements for kiss of death/deny and NTS NAC codes, improved NTPV5 negotiation in older NTP versions, and improved specification of the correction extension field. Remaining issues include reference IDs of stratum one servers and synchronization loop prevention.</li>
<li><strong>Rough Time:</strong> Focusing on the protocol draft. Aiming for working group last call by the next IETF meeting. The ecosystem draft was dropped due to lack of implementation interest.</li>
<li><strong>1588 Coordination:</strong> Discussed ongoing work in the 1588 community, including 1588 D (GDOI key management), PTP vulnerabilities, and the new 1588.1 (Client Server PTP).  Informal meeting held to bring the two communities together, with follow-up planned.</li>
<li><strong>NTS for PTP Status:</strong> Small paragraph explaining the scope of NTS for PTP to be added within two-three weeks. Implementation is 60-70% finished, with initial testing planned for August/September. A major update with additional sections is planned for early next year.</li>
<li><strong>Hackathon Projects:</strong> Considering NTPV5 and NTS for PTP projects for the November IETF meeting. Rough Time implementation may be ready for working group last call negating the need for a hackathon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Chairs to ensure the NTPV5 authors are aware of the need to include text explaining why a new version is being created instead of extending existing ones.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Move the NTS for PTP document to the NTP GitHub repo.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Continue development of the NTPV5 Requirements draft before deciding on publication.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Martin to add a small paragraph explaining the scope of NTS for PTP within two-three weeks.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Schedule an interim call in early to mid-September. Chairs to coordinate on dates.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Watson to provide server information on the mailing list</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Address IESG comments on the Enterprise Profile and Registries documents.</li>
<li>Send NTP over PTP to the IESG after the shepherd write-up is complete.</li>
<li>Continue development of NTPV5 drafts, focusing on addressing identified issues and improving readability.</li>
<li>Report back to the 1588 community and schedule a follow-up informal discussion in September.</li>
<li>Plan for hackathon projects at the November IETF meeting.</li>
<li>Schedule an interim call for early to mid-September.</li>
<li>Encourage more reviews on the working group documents.</li>
