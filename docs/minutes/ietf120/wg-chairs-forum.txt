# WG Chairs Forum

## Summary

The Working Group Chairs Forum at IETF 120 covered several important topics including the Note Well, IPR disclosures, sustainability in networking, and IAB workshops. Legal counsel provided guidance on the Note Well and IPR matters, while a presentation on sustainability aimed to encourage consideration of environmental impact in protocol design. An overview of IAB workshops highlighted their role in fostering discussion and collaboration.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **The Note Well:**
    *   The Note Well is a reminder of IETF policies, not the policy itself.
    *   Emphasis on providing sufficient time for participants to read the Note Well.
    *   Discussion on whether a supplementary slide on anti-harassment procedures should be encouraged.
    *   Suggestions for shortening and simplifying the Note Well text.
    *   Proposal to include a "last modified date" on the Note Well to encourage periodic review.
    *   Recommendation to remind participants about the Note Well earlier, such as during mailing list subscription and registration.
    *   Questioning the need to present the Note Well at every working group session.
*   **IPR Disclosures:**
    *   Handling IPR disclosures where the patent claim appears abandoned. Chairs have discretion.
    *   Clarification on the boilerplate text used in patent disclosures and the IETF's hands-off approach.
    *   Questioning the feasibility of proactive patent clearance by the IETF.
    *   Caution against applying standard patent disclosure templates automatically in IRTF settings.
*   **Sustainability in Networking:**
    *   Need to translate high-level sustainability aspects into actionable targets within working groups.
    *   Importance of considering environmental parameters (energy, emissions, resource use) in protocol design.
    *   Challenges of over-engineering and including "nice-to-have" features.
    *   Importance of systems thinking to address the complexity of sustainability.
    *   Call for working groups to audit their current standing and identify low-hanging fruit for emissions reduction.
*   **IAB Workshops:**
    *   IAB workshops are a valuable tool for fostering discussion and bringing in outside experts.
    *   Success factors include enabling unique conversations, well-defined scope, and long-term impact.
    *   Outcomes can include standards work, research group creation, and community engagement.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IESG to discuss the possibility of shortening and simplifying the Note Well text.**
*   **IETF Executive Director to add a reminder to read the Note Well in the welcome email for future meetings.**
*   **Robert Sparks to provide pointers to documents after RFC 2026 that speak to patent analysis.**
*   **WG chairs to audit their groups for sustainability issues and low hanging fruit.**

## Next Steps

*   Participants are encouraged to contribute to the existing Internet-Drafts on sustainability.
*   Interested individuals can attend the IAB open meeting to discuss upcoming IAB workshops.
*   WG Chairs were asked to bring lunch garbage when leaving the room.
