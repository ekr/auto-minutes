## Summary

The intarea meeting covered several drafts related to network address translation, ICMP extensions, and proxy configurations.  Presentations included updates on proxy configuration provisioning, extending ICMP for probes and stateless reverse traceroute, a source address validation solution for wireless LANs, web proxy auto-discovery, and the EVN6 network model. Discussions centered around the utility, security implications, and deployment scenarios for these technologies. There were calls for working group adoption for several drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Proxy Configuration in Provisioning Domains:**
    *   Discussion around adding HTTP version support (ALPN) to proxy configurations.
    *   Concerns raised about prioritizing optimization for HTTP endpoints using IP hostnames.
    *   Debate on matching and excluding domains/subnets within DNS configurations, and name conventions like "match domain" vs "excluded domain".
    *   Consideration of authentication methods for proxies and whether to include authentication hints in the configuration.

*   **ICMP Extended Echo (Probe):**
    *   Clarifications made based on surveys of existing implementations.
    *   Request for working group adoption of the RFCBIS.
    *   Suggestion for informal interop testing before moving forward.

*   **Extending ICMP for Stateless Reverse Route Trace Route:**
    *   Proposal to use ICMP extensions to add information to ICMP errors for traceroute.
    *   Discussion around incorporating more user-readable information beyond IP addresses and hostnames.
    *   Concerns about the incentive for operators to keep node name information updated.

*   **Stateless Reverse Trace Route:**
    *   Presentation of a new ICMP request and response for reverse traceroute functionality.
    *   Analysis of RIP Atlas data to assess the feasibility of stateless RTT estimation.
    *   Debate on stateful vs. stateless implementation and security implications.
    *   Discussion on ICMP blackholing issues related to trace route

*   **SAVI for Wireless LANs (W-LAN):**
    *   Explanation of the problem statement, focusing on the lack of naturally secure binding anchors in wireless LANs and user roaming challenges.
    *   Discussion of limitations with existing solutions.
    *   Consideration given to the validation of IPV6 address prefixes.

*   **Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD):**
    *   Discussion about slimming down WPAD and deprecating certain discovery mechanisms, such as DNS domain devolution.
    *   Considering just DHCP only.
    *   Considering requiring user consent.
    *   Discussion on deprecating portions of WPAD.

*   **Extending ICMP for Translation in V6-only Networks:**
    *   Proposed method for translating untranslatable IPv6 addresses in IPv6-only networks.
    *   Introduction of an "IP Original Source" extension object.
    *   Need to merge with Bill's draft was suggested.

*   **EVN6 (Encapsulated Virtual Network 6):**
    *   Explanation of the layer two network model built on top of IPv6.
    *   Testing the capability to transfer file from one host to another.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Expired Drafts:** The working group will reach out to the authors of expired drafts before declaring them dead.
*   **Communicating Proxy Configurations in Provisioning Domains:** Authors to investigate incorporating the well-known ECH draft in the TLS working group. Authors to evaluate the matching and excluding domains/subnets format, as well as the interaction between "match domain" and "excluded domain". Consider more detailed functions that are commonly used in PAC files.
*   **ICMP Extended Echo (Probe):**  Working group to consider adopting the draft. Authors to change the name in the document to RFC 8335 BIS after working group adoption.
*   **Extending ICMP for Stateless Reverse Route Trace Route:** Working group to consider adopting the draft.
*   **Stateless Reverse Trace Route:** Working group to consider adopting the draft.
*   **Extending ICMP for Translation in V6-only Networks:** Merge the draft to Bill's draft or use an extension to be defined in Bill's draft.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion and provide feedback on the mailing lists.
*   Evaluate working group adoption for the presented drafts.
*   Authors to revise drafts based on the feedback received.
