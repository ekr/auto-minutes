## Summary

The Apply Networking Research Workshop (ANRW) 2024 kicked off with a welcome message, followed by a keynote from Sharad Gargwal of Microsoft on leveraging AI/ML for 5G and 6G systems. The workshop then transitioned into a measurement session featuring two papers. The first paper discussed the challenges of HTTP/3's Extensible Prioritization Scheme (EPS) in real-world deployments, and the second paper introduced the concept of the observer effect in computer networks and its implications for network measurement.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Keynote (Sharad Gargwal):**
    *   Leveraging cloud scale to overcome limitations of deployed network protocols.
    *   The importance of using off-the-shelf learning algorithms whenever possible.
    *   Mitigation strategies for hallucinations in generative AI models for network management.
    *   High bandwidth, low latency, and high reliability are key challenges in Cloudified Telecom infrastructure.
    *   Traffic engineering and management using learning algorithms to shift traffic from overloaded peering links.
    *   Using AI agents to automate troubleshooting guide execution, reducing downtime in 5G deployments.
*   **HTTP/3's EPS in the Wild:**
    *   Significant heterogeneity in browser and server implementations of EPS.
    *   Lack of full support for EPS by major deployments, creating a "chicken and egg" problem.
    *   Inconsistent application of heuristics and default scheduling behaviors.
    *   Recommendations include full support for EPS, improved developer APIs, further research into loading heuristics, and realistic testing resources.
*   **The Observer Effect in Computer Networks:**
    *   Measurement overhead can impact network performance (e.g., packet loss).
    *   The uncertainty relation quantifies the trade-off between measurement accuracy and network impact.
    *   Introduction of the "observer factor" as a practical metric for evaluating the overhead of measurement protocols.
    *   The observer factor is easy to compute and allows for apples-to-apples comparison of different measurement methods.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Potential Action Item:** Investigate the possibility of standardizing the observer factor calculation to aid in the design of future measurement protocols within the IETF.

## Next Steps

*   The workshop will continue with sessions on routing and congestion, security and energy, and lightning papers.

## Summary

The Applied Networking Research Workshop (anrw) session featured three presentations covering diverse topics: location-aware advertising in ENICAS IP networks, empirical characterization of Anycast convergence time, and diffusing computation for loop-free short-path routing.  A fourth presentation covered traffic management focusing on Quality of Experience.  The first presentation investigated regional trends and selective announcements in ENICAS routing. The second presentation empirically measured Anycast convergence times from an end-host perspective. The third presentation introduced a new routing protocol, "Dare," designed to improve the efficiency of diffusing computations. The fourth presentation looked at better Quality of Experience traffic management. Each presentation was followed by a Q&A session.

*   **Dare: Diffusing Compute More Efficient for Loop Free Short-Spat Routing:**
    *   Introduced a new routing protocol ("Dare") to improve the efficiency of diffusing computations compared to DUAL.
    *   Discussed how Dare remembers which neighbors initiated diffusing computations, reducing signaling overhead.
    *   Explained that Dare allows routers to change successors at any time, regardless of active or passive state.
    *   A concern was raised regarding interoperability with existing DUAL implementations.
*   **Traffic Management Focusing on Quality of Experience:**
    *   Presented a novel approach to traffic management, focused on the Quality of Experience in real time media.
    *   Showed the need for better collaboration among the actors, in particular the Application and the Network.

    *   Future work: Investigate the underlying factors driving the need for selective routing towards regional neighbors.
*   **Empirical Characterization of Anycast Convergence Time:**
    *   Future work: Increase measurement resolution by scanning faster and investigate regional differences in convergence times, including looking at IPV6.
*    **Dare: Diffusing Compute More Efficient for Loop Free Short-Spat Routing:**
     *   Future work: Incorporate "Dare" into a routing protocol for larger-scale simulations and evaluations, and comparison with Link State protocols.
*    **Traffic Management Focusing on Quality of Experience:**
     *  Future work: Explore how to efficiently calculate these spatial complexity curves all the time.

## Next Steps

## Summary

This meeting focused on several aspects of network resilience and security, including carbon-aware routing with BGP, integrity protection for in-band telemetry (IOAM), security assessment of internet paths for critical infrastructure, and fixes for KeyTrap vulnerabilities. The session covered both theoretical concepts and practical implementation challenges, sparking discussions about deployment considerations, performance trade-offs, and potential improvements to existing protocols.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Low-Car BGP:**
    *   Discussion around the motivation for green routing and how to incentivize ISPs to prioritize greener AS paths.
    *   Metrics for measuring greenness were explored, including carbon intensity and carbon performance ratings.
    *   Concerns were raised about the potential for increased congestion on green paths and the impact on overall network performance.
    *   Question on how carbon intensity values can accurately represent the ingress and egress pairing of traffic through an AS.
*   **IOAM Integrity Protection:**
    *   Several options for integrity protection were reviewed, focusing on GMAC-based methods.
    *   Trade-offs between check-on-transit nodes and zero-trust solutions were discussed.
    *   Performance evaluations of different options were presented, highlighting the impact on encapsulation, transit, and decapsulation nodes.
    *   The use of IPsec for inter-domain use cases was considered, but ultimately deemed less desirable due to potential path changes.
*   **Assessing Security of Internet Paths:**
    *   Research questions centered on the number of fully and partially ROV-protected paths and the impact of a CI's upstream provider implementing ROV.
    *   Method for calculating the security status of a path by combining path finding with ROV scoring and RPKI invalid prefix filtering.
