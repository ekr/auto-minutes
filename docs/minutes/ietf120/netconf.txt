## Summary

The NETCONF working group session at IETF 120 covered a wide range of topics, including list pagination, transaction IDs, trace context, private candidates, versioning in Yang notifications, UDP-based transports, distributed notifications, and the standardization of Netconf event notifications. Several drafts were discussed, and decisions were made regarding working group last calls and future directions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **List Pagination:** Discussed the latest updates to the pagination drafts, including addressing Young Doctor review comments. Open issues remain on `limited=0`, locale for `order-by`, and XML list examples. Implementation status was provided.
*   **Transaction ID and Trace Context:**  The transaction ID draft is nearing completion. The trace context drafts (Netconf and Restconf) are mature with existing implementations. Discussion about registering the protocol with W3C emerged.
*   **External Transaction ID for Configuration Tracing:** Discussion on adding client ID to the RPC node for tracing configuration changes. There was debate about whether using Yang annotations was the appropriate approach.
*   **Netconf Private Candidates:**  The draft allows independent candidate configurations per session. Discussion revolved around NMDA client support, conflict detection, and augmentation approaches.
*   **Versioning in Yang Notifications:** Adding version information to notification messages was discussed. The document has two implementations and is part of the NEMO message broker integration effort.
*   **UDP-based Transport for Configured Subscriptions:** Discussion on refining the UDP notive draft and whether a default port is needed.  Raised issues related to having consistency between UDP and TCP client/server groupings.
*   **Subscription to Distributed Notification:** Update on the distributed notification draft. Includes adding the publisher ID to notifications. There was a need to know the X path those child subscriptions.
*   **Yang Model for Netconf Event Notifications:** Discussed the need for a Yang model to validate Yang push notifications. The structure only validates event time. The new proposal is to use normative text. Discussion led to the decision to schedule an interim meeting.
*   **Hostname and Sequencing in Yang Notifications:** The addition of hostname and sequence numbers to notification headers was discussed. Concerns were raised about backwards compatibility and the relevance of sequence numbers for non-UDP transports.
*   **Timestamping in Yang Notifications:** This session discussed Observation time to notification headers.
*   **NetConFover Quick:** Quick provides a modern protocol with enhanced security and low latency.
*   **Yang Groupings for Quick Clients and Quick Servers:** Configuration for quick clients. Whether this model should be held up for HTTP client draft was posed.
*   **Restconf and Netconf Feature Parity:** Discussion about the need for feature parity between Restconf and Netconf and how to enforce that within the working group.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Transaction ID:** Working group last call to be started immediately after the meeting.
*   **Trace Context:** Working group last call to be started after this meeting. Roque to investigate registration with W3C without involving IETF.
*   **Netconf Private Candidates:** Authors to take feedback and propose a solution for NMDA client handling in the next revision.
*   **UDP-based Transport:** Authors to consult with IANA designated experts regarding the need for a default port.
*   **UDP/TCP groupings:** Take discussion to list.
*   **Distributed Notification:** A desire to go to working group last call was discussed. Will push other drafts first and revisit later.
*   **Yang Model for Netconf Event Notifications:** An interim meeting to be scheduled to discuss the document.
*   **Hostname and Sequencing in Yang Notifications:** Authors to consider feedback regarding backwards compatibility and the necessity of including hostname in all notifications.
*   **NetConFover Quick:** Adoption of NetConFover Quick was requested.
*   **Augment Yang Library,** The Netconf working group has had a show of hands and decided that, yes, this is an interesting draft.

## Next Steps

*   Working group last calls for drafts as decided.
*   Authors to address open issues and comments on their respective drafts.
*   Schedule an interim meeting to discuss the Yang Model for Netconf Event Notifications draft.
*   Continue discussion on the mailing list for items that require further deliberation.
* Move to adoption of augment Yang.
