<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 22 Jul 2024 16:30</p>
<h1>satp</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The SATP working group meeting focused on the progress of three core drafts: the core protocol document, the architecture document, and the use case document.  Discussions covered the demarcation of stage one from stage zero, updates to the architecture figure, the concept of context ID, security considerations, and the next steps for each document. The working group also discussed milestones and rechartering possibilities.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Milestone Dates:</strong> The working group reviewed and adjusted milestone dates. The architecture and protocol documents are estimated to be ready in six months (January 2024), while the use case document needs a year (July 2024).</li>
<li><strong>Stage Zero vs. Stage One:</strong> Discussions clarified the boundary between stage zero (out of scope for the current charter, focusing on pre-SATP context establishment) and stage one (the core SATP protocol). All stage zero negotiations will be moved out before stage one.</li>
<li><strong>Architecture Diagram Update:</strong> The architecture diagram was updated to include a direct interaction path between the application and the gateway (API 1), aligning with the core document.</li>
<li><strong>Context ID:</strong> Context ID was made mandatory in the core protocol. The discussion clarified its role in linking related asset transfers at the application level across multiple sessions, even though atomic commitment is out of scope of the current charter.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Security was discussed, with emphasis on the need to ensure end-to-end atomicity and integrity of asset transfers. The group acknowledged the lack of a separate threat modeling document.</li>
<li><strong>Core and Architecture Document Relationship:</strong> The relationship between the core and architecture documents was discussed.  It was decided that the core document will be updated to include more pointers to the architecture document, and it will be recommended that readers read the architecture document first.</li>
<li><strong>Use Cases Document:</strong> A new section on use cases that augment existing internet protocols with more trust by using distributed ledgers was added. Additional use cases that do not focus on DLTs and blockchains will be added.</li>
<li><strong>Stage Zero Draft:</strong> An existing internet draft for stage zero was discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Network vs Asset Network:</strong> The term &quot;network&quot; was clarified as being an &quot;asset network&quot;. All documents will be updated to reflect this.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> The chair will work with the area director on the implications of releasing Core and Architecture documents together.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Editors add sufficient pointers in the core document back to the architecture document. State in the Core document that readers should read Architecture first before Core.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Add more text about use cases that do not focus on DLT/Blockchain to the use case document.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Implementors of SATP to provide clarity to authors on any assumptions made. Claire to reach out to an intern at Quantum to get their feedback on the documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Add any links that showcase the Peter Liu proposed pay as you watch use case to the Use Case document.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Update all documents to use the term &quot;asset network&quot; instead of &quot;network&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Milestone dates were adjusted with Architecture and Protocol documents targeted for January 2024 and Use Case for July 2024.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Context ID was made mandatory.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate feedback from the meeting, especially on dependencies between the architecture and core documents, and on expanding the use case document.</li>
<li>Open the use case document for working group last call as soon as new use cases are added.</li>
<li>Authors to address any remaining directorate review comments.</li>
<li>Consider a rechartering discussion in November.</li>
<li>Schedule an interim meeting in approximately one month.</li>
</ul>
