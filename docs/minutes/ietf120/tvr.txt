## Summary

This IETF meeting focused on the Time-Variant Networks (TVR) working group's progress on key deliverables, including the requirements document, YANG schedule model, and applicability statement. Discussions covered milestone adjustments, security concerns, data model consistency, and potential use cases. The group explored readiness for working group last calls and discussed plans for a hackathon in Dublin.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Milestone Adjustments:** Extended dates, particularly around the applicability statement, with a focus on finishing requirements and the data model.
*   **TVR Requirements Document:** Discussion on security considerations, the need for a stronger statement, and the possible impact of network schedules on security.
*   **YANG Schedule Model:** Review of changes, including refactoring and data type adjustments. Debate on the use of dotted quad versus URI for node IDs and the general purpose nature of the model.
*   **ALTO Applicability:** Presentation on using ALTO for exposing time-variant routing information, with discussion on granularity, conflict resolution, and reverting changes.
*   **TVR Applicability Statement:** Introduction of a framework for control scheduling of network resources and application of the TVR YANG model, demonstrated through the tidal network use case. Concerns raised regarding the appropriateness of TVR for actively monitoring the network versus following a schedule.
*   **Hackathon in Dublin:** Plan to discuss and implement the YANG model with a possible focus on the tidal network use case.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Requirements Document:**
    *   Authors will add an introduction section to the requirements document.
    *   Authors will review and potentially strengthen the security section based on discussions around the impact of time-variant networks on security.
*   **YANG Schedule Model:**
    *   Authors will scrub the model for consistency, particularly regarding node ID (dotted quad vs. URI).
    *   Authors will address naming conventions related to schedule IDs.
*   **ALTO Applicability:**
    *   Authors will report in new gaps that appears on that implementation.
*   **General:**
    *   TVR working group will further discuss the scope of the group's work on solutions in relation to charter after completion of current milestones.
    *   Hackathon planning will be posted to the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to revise documents based on meeting discussions.
*   Participants to provide feedback on the mailing list regarding the requirements document, YANG schedule model, and applicability statement.
*   Further discussion and iterations of the YANG Schedule Model and ALTO drafts before the next IETF meeting.
*   Publication of hackathon plans to the mailing list.
*   Working group last call on the requirements document after adding introduction and addressing security considerations.
