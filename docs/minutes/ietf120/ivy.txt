## Summary

The IETF IVY working group session focused on three key presentations: a YANG data model for network inventory, network inventory software extensions and topology models, and asset lifecycle management and operations.  The discussions revolved around the complexity of modeling physical and logical network components, particularly ports and breakouts, and the scope of the working group charter regarding entitlements, capabilities, and licenses.  Several participants emphasized the need for a simplified model that aligns with existing implementations like OpenConfig.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Port and Breakout Modeling:** Extensive discussion about the complexities of modeling ports, pluggable transceivers, and breakout cables. Three approaches were analyzed: 8348-like, OpenConfig-like, and TAPI.  The group debated whether breakouts should be handled in the physical inventory model or the logical view.
*   **Simplicity vs. Completeness:**  A strong push for a simplified model capable of capturing common use cases, even if it means deferring more complex scenarios to future iterations. Several participants highlighted the need for the model to be implementable in a timely manner.
*   **OpenConfig Alignment:**  A preference for aligning with OpenConfig models and structures to reduce friction and facilitate implementation, although the group acknowledges the need to clarify ambiguities and provide guidelines.
*   **Inventory Topology Modeling:** Discussion of mapping nodes to network elements in the inventory topology model.  The question of whether a node can map to multiple network elements was raised, along with a proposal for addressing it using constructed topologies.  A question was raised if topology should reference inventory or inventory should reference topology.
*   **Software Inventory Extensions:**  Presentation on software extensions to the base inventory model, including software installation and activation times.  Feedback was requested on where software patch definitions should reside.
*   **Asset Lifecycle Management (ALMO):** Discussion on modeling entitlements, capabilities, and licenses, which are linked to how devices operate. The group debated whether capabilities fall under the current working group charter. The topic of support contracts as part of asset management was also discussed.
*   **Working Group Charter Scope:** Significant debate surrounding the scope of the working group's charter, particularly regarding entitlements, capabilities, and licenses.  Concerns were raised about whether the model was exceeding the scope and a proposal was made to carve out portions of ALMO for later consideration.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:**  Italo will continue to analyze the three port and breakout modeling approaches, considering feedback on simplicity and alignment with existing implementations.
*   **Action Item:** Camillo and team to brainstorm how to move forward with ALMO, considering feedback on charter scope and the inclusion of capabilities, licenses and support contracts.
*   **Action Item:**  Working group to clarify its preference for one of the three port and breakout modeling options (8348, OpenConfig, or TAPI).
*   **Action Item:** Consider hackathon to explore implementation options.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs will solicit working group adoption of the software extensions and topology models.

## Next Steps

*   Mailing list discussion on the preferred port and breakout modeling approach.
*   Further discussion on the ALMO scope and how to address entitlements and capabilities.
*   Potential joint work to create implementation and concrete examples for the models.
