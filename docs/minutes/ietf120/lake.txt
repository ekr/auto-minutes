## Summary

The LAKE working group meeting at IETF 120 covered several key topics, including updates on the Lightweight Authorization using Ad-hoc (ALTS) draft, implementation considerations for EDOC, remote attestation over ad-hoc, and pre-shared key-based authentication methods. The group discussed potential privacy issues and debated the best approaches for advertising LAKE ALTS support. The meeting also included a discussion about pre-shared key authentication methods in ad-hoc.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Lightweight Authorization using Ad-hoc (ALTS):**
    *   Discussion on advertising support for LAKE ALTS, focusing on two approaches: layer 2 beacons and CoAP anycast responses.
    *   Considerations around privacy implications and implementation complexities of each approach.
*   **Implementation Considerations for EDOC:**
    *   Updates on the implementation considerations draft, including the use of EDOC with CoAP and blockwise fragmentation.
    *   Discussion on trust models for learning peer credentials, particularly in the context of ACE framework profiles.
*   **Remote Attestation over Ad-hoc:**
    *   Presentation on extending remote attestation capabilities, including reverse and mutual attestation flows.
    *   Discussion on background check and passport models, as well as freshness of attestation results.
*   **Pre-shared Key-based Authentication Method:**
    *   Presentation of two variants for pre-shared key authentication in ad-hoc.
    *   Trade-offs between privacy, security, and resource allocation in each variant.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **ALTS Advertisement:** Start a thread on the mailing list to discuss and resolve the best approach for advertising LAKE ALTS support, considering the pros and cons of each method.
*   **Remote Attestation:** Encourage the working group to review the remote attestation draft with the expectation of a call for adoption in the next month or two.
*   **Pre-shared Key Authentication:** Send a mail to the list soliciting other drafts for consideration. If no others are offered, proceed with evaluating the current draft from Elsa and schedule an interim meeting on this topic.
*   **Ad-hoc standardization:** Note the start of an IEEE project to standardize ad-hoc now in IEEE 154. Inform the list about the project.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for ALTS advertisement and pre-shared key authentication.
*   Schedule an interim meeting to discuss pre-shared key authentication in detail and conduct a security analysis of the proposed variants.
*   Prepare for a call for adoption of the remote attestation draft, assuming positive feedback from the working group.
