## Summary

The pquip working group meeting covered several documents related to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Discussions included the "PQC for Engineers" draft, hybrid terminology, hybrid signature spectrums, NIST's post-quantum standardization efforts, migration use cases, and hash-based signature schemes. The meeting addressed potential last calls for some drafts and future directions for the working group.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **PQC for Engineers Draft:**
    *   Authors believe the draft is nearly complete and proposed a working group last call after IETF 120.
    *   The draft serves as an IETF-focused PQC primer.
    *   Participants were encouraged to review the draft and provide feedback, specifically identifying any missing topics or areas for improvement.

*   **Hybrid Terminology Draft:**
    *   The draft standardizes terminology for post-quantum/traditional hybrids.
    *   A working group last call was conducted in February, resulting in updates to the draft.
    *   There was a discussion of the scope of the document and where to address more complex aspects of hybrid security, potentially in another draft.
    *   A second working group last call is likely.

*   **Hybrid Signature Spectrums Draft:**
    *   This document describes different security properties and spectrums related to hybrid signature construction.
    *   Discussions were held around separability, generality, and artifact locations within hybrid signatures.
    *   The draft includes language on why one would use a hybrid signature, a hybrid PQ traditional signature, versus not going PQ at all, or going directly to PQ and not doing hybrid at all.
    *   Consensus on these additions may be challenging.
    *   Discussion regarding strong non-separable (fused) hybrid signatures, including potential use cases.
    *   A working group last call may flush out any further issues.

*   **NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Update:**
    *   NIST provided an update on its post-quantum cryptography standardization process.
    *   Four algorithms are in the standardization track: ML-KEM (Kyber), ML-DSA (Dilithium), Falcon, and SPHINCS+.
    *   Round 4 candidates are being evaluated, with a focus on Classically Enhanced McEliece (Classic McEliece), BIKE, and HQC.
    *   On-ramp signature candidates are also being evaluated.
    *   Relaxation of restrictions around state copying in SP 800-208 is planned.
    *   A special-purpose publication discussing ML-KEM deployment scenarios is forthcoming.

*   **Migration Use Cases Taxonomy Draft:**
    *   This document aims to guide engineers in choosing appropriate algorithms and parameters for post-quantum migration based on factors like duration, backwards compatibility, and protocol negotiation capabilities.
    *   The draft was revised to address previous feedback.
    *   The decision tree was updated to rely on objective measurements rather than subjective opinions.
    *   Exploration of a "pessimistic migration" approach is under consideration.

*   **Hash-Based Signature Schemes Draft:**
    *   Document on how to manage the stateful part of hash-based signature schemes like XMSS and LMS.
    *   Feedback was received to add when stateful schemes are appropriate in the first place.
    *   The authors propose adopting the draft.

*   **PQC Hackathon:**
    *   Positive work being done at the PQC Hackathon with new GitHub actions enabling interoperability testing.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Participants to review "PQC for Engineers" draft and provide feedback on missing topics or areas for improvement.
*   **Action Item:** Authors of the "Hybrid Terminology" draft to proceed with a second working group last call.
*   **Action Item:** Authors of the "Hybrid Signature Spectrums" draft to prepare for a working group last call.
*   **Action Item:** Britta Hale to push to CFRG a few strong, non-separable construction which use P-56 and MLDSA.
*   **Action Item:** Alexander to include information about PQC Hackathon to the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for all documents.
*   Begin working group last calls for drafts where consensus is reached.
*   Consider adoption of drafts when appropriate.
*   Monitor progress of NIST's post-quantum cryptography standardization efforts.
