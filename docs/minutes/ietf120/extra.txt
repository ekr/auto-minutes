## Summary

This was a joint session of the "extra" and "mailmaid" working groups. The first part of the meeting focused on the "extra" working group, reviewing the status of several documents and discussing the future of the group. The bulk of the session was then dedicated to "mailmaid" topics, including presentations and discussions of proposed work items related to email usability and security. A charter discussion regarding implementation commitments also took place, followed by a call for adoption of client ID drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

### Extra Documents

*   **6855 BIS and JMAP Access:** Both documents are considered "cooked" and ready to proceed.
*   **Message Limit:** A revised ID is needed; Alexi to revise.
*   **Calendars JMAP:** Waiting for IANA review; author unresponsive.
*   **Working Group Status:** The working group will remain open until existing work is completed.

### Mailmaid: Wrong Recipient Feature

*   John Levine presented a draft proposing a "wrong recipient" feature, similar to the "unsubscribe" mechanism, using a POST request to a designated URL.
*   The goal is to allow recipients to easily notify senders that they received mail intended for someone else, particularly useful for transactional mail.
*   Concerns were raised about tying the mechanism to a web interface and potential for misuse by phishers.
*   There was general support for the idea, and an action item was created to call for adoption on the mailing list.

### Mailmaid: Expires Header Field

*   John Levine presented a draft reviving the "Expires" header field, specifying when a message is no longer relevant.
*   Discussions revolved around the meaning and interpretation of the "Expires" header, and whether it should trigger any specific actions by MUAs or MTAs.
*   John Klensin offered to incorporate the changes directly into the AS document.
*   Murray raised concerns about non-agreement over what expires means.
*   Ultimately, the group agreed to adopt the document and further discuss semantics on the mailing list.

### Mailmaid: Unicode Email Addresses

*   Art presented a draft proposing a BCP to define a safer character repertoire for provisioning and validating human addresses.
*   John Klensin expressed concerns about creating competing standards and suggested updating the existing SMTP UTF-8 specifications instead.
*   A conversation between Art, John Klensin, Murray, and the chairs will be organized to hash out a potential plan.

### Mailmaid: Charter Discussion

*   Concerns regarding the charter requirement for implementation commitments before adopting standards-track documents were discussed.
*   The requirement was intended to prevent the working group from spending time on documents that would not be implemented.
*   There was general agreement to maintain the existing charter language.

### Client ID Draft Adoption

*   A request was made to adopt the client ID drafts, which have been implemented by several vendors and open-source projects.
*   The group supported adopting these drafts, and a call was made to adopt it on the list.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Alexi:** Revise the "Message Limit" draft.
*   **Murray:** Submit both 6855 and Jamip axis to IETF last call
*   **John Levine:** Call for adoption of the "wrong recipient" draft on the mailing list.
*   **John Klensin:** Collaborate with John Levine to incorporate "Expires" header changes into the AS document.
*   **Art:** Organize a conversation with John Klensin, Murray, and the chairs to discuss the Unicode email address draft.
*   **Michael:** Make a call for adoption for the client ID drafts on the list.

## Next Steps

*   Discuss the semantics of the "Expires" header on the mailing list.
*   Hash out a plan for addressing the Unicode email address issue through discussions and subsequent updates on the mailing list.
*   Continue discussions about the client ID drafts and move towards adoption.
