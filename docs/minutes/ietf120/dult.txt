## Summary
The DULT working group meeting focused on reviewing the individual drafts for detecting unwanted location trackers. Drafts 4, 3, and aspects of 1 & 2 were discussed. The goal was to assess their readiness for working group adoption. Key topics included threat modeling, crowdsourced network architecture, and protocol specifications. The group also discussed finding a volunteer to write document 2.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Threat Model (Draft 4):**
    *   Discussion of in-scope and out-of-scope technologies, attacker profiles, and victim profiles.
    *   Considered the scenario where the tracker owner is also the victim.
    *   Agreement that the document is a good starting point for adoption.
*   **Crowdsourced Network Architecture (Draft 1):**
    *   Explored the current state of unwanted tracking and existing crowdsourced finding networks.
    *   Identified issues with existing frameworks, such as anonymous uploading/downloading of reports, counterfeit devices, and potential for tracking legitimate tag owners.
    *   Discussed ideal properties and features for crowdsourced networks, including authentication, privacy preservation, and prevention of spoofing.
    *   Outlined five stages for architectural proposal: initial pairing, accessory setup, nearby owner mode, separated/lost mode, and owner device query.
    *   Considered the use of partial blind signatures for authentication.
*   **Accessory Protocol (Draft 3):**
    *   Covered the protocol between accessories and non-owner nearby devices, including data formats.
    *   Discussed Bluetooth Low Energy, NFC, location tracking, payload of advertisements, and Bluetooth MAC addresses.
    *   Addressed service data at TLV, network ID, near/owner bit, advertising interval, Bluetooth connections, and proprietary company payload.
    *   Explored accessory information (opcodes), disablement identification, owner registry, and accessory category information.
    *   Identified the need to potentially reorganise the document to be transport agnostic.
*   **Unwanted Tracking Detection Algorithm (Draft 2):**
    *   Needed a volunteer to author this document, which would define the algorithm for detecting unwanted tracking by legitimate trackers.
    *   Discussion of example scenario involving malicious tracking.
*   **Active Scanning**
    *   Discussion around active scanning definition and how platform could expose active scanning tools.
    *   Active Scanning in the context of domestic violence situations.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Draft 4 (Threat Model):** A working group adoption call will be initiated. Issues and pull requests for adding details on compromised states for tracker manufacturers should be added to the GitHub repo or mailing list.
*   **Draft 3 (Accessory Protocol):** A working group adoption call will be initiated. Editorial reorganisation should take place *after* adoption.
*   **Draft 1 (Crowdsourced Network Architecture):** The document will be published and a working group adoption call will be initiated.
*   **Draft 2 (Unwanted Tracking Detection Algorithm):** Alex Heinrich to be approached to author the document.
*   **Charter Updates**: The mailing list will be used to discuss the alert requirements for different OS's and potential charter updates.

## Next Steps
*   Start working group adoption calls for drafts 4, 3 and 1.
*   Recruit Alex Heinrich to author document 2.
*   Open mailing list discussion on OS alerts and charter updates.
