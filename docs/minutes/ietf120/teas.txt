## Summary

The TEAS working group meeting covered document status updates, presentations on several drafts including 5GNS IPMP, NRP Yang Models, Scalability Considerations for NRP, Application Layer 5G Network Slices, Network Slice Controller Models, Customer Intent Topology, 5G QoS to DSCP mapping, and CTN POI Assurance.  The meeting included a farewell to Lou Berger as a chair, and discussion regarding adoption of new drafts and merging existing documents. Polls were conducted to gauge interest and consensus on document direction.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Status:** Several documents are in the editor queue or waiting for IESG processing. The 8776 update is blocking other documents and authors are urged to submit a new version.
*   **5GNS IPMP Draft:** Discussion around transport plane vs. network slice partition vs. filter topology, liaison with 3GPP, and terminology.
*   **NRP Yang Models:** Feedback on PHB Profile List and NIP monitoring. Open issues regarding normative reference of topology filter draft and the NRP device model.
*   **Scalability Considerations for NRP:** Discussion regarding scalability design principles, impact on routing protocols, and whether the draft constrains operator deployments.
*   **Application Layer 5G Network Slices:**  Efforts to improve readability and coordination with other drafts.
*   **Network Slice Controller Models:** Discussion on models between mapper and realizer, customer vs. provider views.
*   **Customer Intent Topology:** Aim is to provide a mechanism for customers to express network intent topology. Discussion on technology agnostic models. Polls were conducted to gauge interest in adoption.
*   **5G QoS to DSCP Mapping:** Scope of the mapping, correlation between 3GPP 5QI and IETF DSCP, grouping of 5QI values, and transport mapping.
*   **CTN POI Assurance:** Focus on multi-layer fault management, discussion of failure scenarios, and upcoming Yang data model definition.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **8776 Update:** Authors to submit a new version of the 8776 update document.
*   **5GNS IPMP Draft:** Authors to rework the Inter-PE transport plane section potentially using the term "underlay transport."
*   **NRP Yang Models:** Bo to follow up with updates on the list. Author to coordinate with solution definition draft.
*   **Scalability Considerations for NRP:** Authors to revise the document based on feedback received.  Consider interim meeting if further discussion is needed.
*   **Installation of Networked Slices in Service-Provided Networks:** Working group is interested in this topic.
*   **Installation of Networked Slices in Service-Provided Networks:** There was an objection to merging this draft with another working group document, the existing draft will not be delayed.
*   **Customer Intent Topology:** Working group is interested in this topic, feedback on how the draft is a good starting point was more muted.
*   **5G QoS to DSCP Mapping:** Authors to assess the conveyance of approach mapping file to the SCP.
*   **CTN POI Assurance:**  Paolo to take feedback on the SBI and gaps in the existing domain and analyze.

## Next Steps

*   Follow-up discussions on mailing lists for open issues and action items.
*   Authors to address comments and prepare new versions of their drafts.
*   Consider an interim meeting to discuss Scalability Considerations for NRP.
*   Request directorate reviews for Application Layer 5G Network Slices draft.
*   Prepare a new version for IETF 121.
