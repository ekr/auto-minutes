<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 23 Jul 2024 22:30</p>
<h1>pquip</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The pquip working group meeting covered several documents related to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Discussions included the &quot;PQC for Engineers&quot; draft, hybrid terminology, hybrid signature spectrums, NIST's post-quantum standardization efforts, migration use cases, and hash-based signature schemes. The meeting addressed potential last calls for some drafts and future directions for the working group.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>PQC for Engineers Draft:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Authors believe the draft is nearly complete and proposed a working group last call after IETF 120.</li>
<li>The draft serves as an IETF-focused PQC primer.</li>
<li>Participants were encouraged to review the draft and provide feedback, specifically identifying any missing topics or areas for improvement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid Terminology Draft:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The draft standardizes terminology for post-quantum/traditional hybrids.</li>
<li>A working group last call was conducted in February, resulting in updates to the draft.</li>
<li>There was a discussion of the scope of the document and where to address more complex aspects of hybrid security, potentially in another draft.</li>
<li>A second working group last call is likely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybrid Signature Spectrums Draft:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This document describes different security properties and spectrums related to hybrid signature construction.</li>
<li>Discussions were held around separability, generality, and artifact locations within hybrid signatures.</li>
<li>The draft includes language on why one would use a hybrid signature, a hybrid PQ traditional signature, versus not going PQ at all, or going directly to PQ and not doing hybrid at all.</li>
<li>Consensus on these additions may be challenging.</li>
<li>Discussion regarding strong non-separable (fused) hybrid signatures, including potential use cases.</li>
<li>A working group last call may flush out any further issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Update:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NIST provided an update on its post-quantum cryptography standardization process.</li>
<li>Four algorithms are in the standardization track: ML-KEM (Kyber), ML-DSA (Dilithium), Falcon, and SPHINCS+.</li>
<li>Round 4 candidates are being evaluated, with a focus on Classically Enhanced McEliece (Classic McEliece), BIKE, and HQC.</li>
<li>On-ramp signature candidates are also being evaluated.</li>
<li>Relaxation of restrictions around state copying in SP 800-208 is planned.</li>
<li>A special-purpose publication discussing ML-KEM deployment scenarios is forthcoming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Migration Use Cases Taxonomy Draft:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This document aims to guide engineers in choosing appropriate algorithms and parameters for post-quantum migration based on factors like duration, backwards compatibility, and protocol negotiation capabilities.</li>
<li>The draft was revised to address previous feedback.</li>
<li>The decision tree was updated to rely on objective measurements rather than subjective opinions.</li>
<li>Exploration of a &quot;pessimistic migration&quot; approach is under consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash-Based Signature Schemes Draft:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Document on how to manage the stateful part of hash-based signature schemes like XMSS and LMS.</li>
<li>Feedback was received to add when stateful schemes are appropriate in the first place.</li>
<li>The authors propose adopting the draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PQC Hackathon:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Positive work being done at the PQC Hackathon with new GitHub actions enabling interoperability testing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Participants to review &quot;PQC for Engineers&quot; draft and provide feedback on missing topics or areas for improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Authors of the &quot;Hybrid Terminology&quot; draft to proceed with a second working group last call.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Authors of the &quot;Hybrid Signature Spectrums&quot; draft to prepare for a working group last call.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Britta Hale to push to CFRG a few strong, non-separable construction which use P-56 and MLDSA.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Alexander to include information about PQC Hackathon to the mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussions on the mailing list for all documents.</li>
<li>Begin working group last calls for drafts where consensus is reached.</li>
<li>Consider adoption of drafts when appropriate.</li>
<li>Monitor progress of NIST's post-quantum cryptography standardization efforts.</li>
</ul>
