## Summary

This meeting covered updates on several anima working group documents, including Brewski AE, JWS signed vouchers, Bruski PRM, and Bruski Discovery. Michael Richardson presented an implementation report on ACP and a new draft proposal for Lightweight Grasp was introduced. There were discussions around AD review status, IANA registry creation, and potential next steps for several drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Bruski AE:** The document is ready for AD go-ahead after addressing comments from Mahesh and the GenArt review. Waiting for IESG evaluation.
*   **JWS Signed Vouchers:** Ready for official AD review by Mahesh.
*   **Bruski PRM:**  Significant restructuring of the document, including a new section on MASA expectations and alignment of pledge status resource data with Bruski. Discussed using local names in IDFID certificates for TLS connections. The document is ready for AD review pending a check by the chairs on recent structural changes.
*   **Bruski Discovery:** The main output of the document is the creation of a registry for discovery mechanisms. There was discussion on how to handle existing deployments of 8995 and the need to note that this document updates 8995. More reviews are desired.
*   **ACP Implementation Report:** Michael Richardson presented on his ACP implementation, highlighting the use of Linux network namespaces and the challenges of using link-local addresses for ESP packets.
*   **Lightweight Grasp:** A new draft proposal for a UDP-based, lightweight version of Grasp was presented as a potential solution for resource-constrained IoT devices. The presenters requested feedback from the working group on whether this is suitable for adoption.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Mahesh to make one more pass on Bruski AE to ensure everything is in order before sending it to the IESG.
*   **Action Item:** Sheng and chair to check the differences between the version of Bruski PRM before last call and the current version to determine if another last call is justified.
*   **Action Item:** Add a note to the Bruski Discovery draft to indicate that it updates RFC 8995.
*   **Decision:** Discuss the usage of local names in IDFID certificates for TLS connections, which came up from the Bruski PRM draft, in the design team meetings or on the list, with Carson-Worman.
*   **Action Item:** Working group members encouraged to review and comment on the Lightweight Grasp draft.

## Next Steps

*   Bruski AE: Await AD go-ahead and IESG evaluation.
*   JWS Signed Vouchers: AD review by Mahesh.
*   Bruski PRM:  Determine if another last call is necessary. AD review by Mahesh, if not.
*   Bruski Discovery: Solicit and incorporate reviews. Aim for working group last call in or before Dublin.
*   Lightweight Grasp: Gather feedback from the working group on potential adoption.
