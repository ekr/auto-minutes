## Summary

The SNAC working group met to discuss the remaining open issues on the SNAC Simple document and plan next steps. The discussion focused on clarifying definitions, addressing deployment scenarios, and refining the behavior of the SNAC router, especially concerning router advertisements and traffic forwarding. A key point was whether and how a SNAC router should handle deprecated prefixes and how to describe the forwarding behavior.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Status:** Review of open issues for the SNAC Simple document. There are 19 open issues, many of which are editorial.
*   **RA Guard:** Resolved issue 75 by adding a reference to RFC 6105, which covers RA Guard. The mention of RA Guard already exists in the appendix.
*   **Managed Infrastructure:**  The group discussed whether SNAC routers are needed for managed infrastructure. The consensus was that management implies operator configuration, which is outside the scope of SNAC's auto-configuration goal. Text was added to the introduction to clarify the scope.
*   **Conflicting Text:** Issue 69 regarding conflicting text between the introduction and stub network definition was discussed. The conflicting text was removed from the introduction and relocated to a non-normative appendix.
*   **Stub Network Definition:** Issue 68, concerning reachability within and beyond the stub network, was addressed. The definition was clarified, and redundant language was removed.
*   **Deprecated Prefixes:** Issue 67, specifying advertising of routes to deprecated prefixes was discussed at length. Consensus was reached that an active SNAC router does not need to advertise deprecated prefixes and non-zero preferred lifetime.
*   **Traffic Forwarding:** The group realized that the document did not explicitly require SNAC routers to forward traffic. A discussion ensued about defensive forwarding and potential firewalling considerations. An issue will be opened to track text for addressing forwarding requirements.
*   **Multiple Stub Networks:** Clarification that the behavior should be consistent across multiple stub networks.
*    **Definition of Advertised**: Issue with defining &quot;advertised&quot; prefixes and possible interpretation in context of RA option.
*   **Out of Scope Appendix**: Discussion around having an appendix that captures all out of scope conversation as context

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Issue 75:** Closed, Reference to RFC 6105 added
*   **Issue 69:** Closed, Conflicting text removed
*   **Issue 68:** Closed, Definition clarified
*   **Issue 67:** Closed, Prefixes with non-zero lifetime and that are deprecated are not advertised
*   **Action Item:** Ted Lemon to open an issue and add text addressing the requirement for SNAC routers to forward traffic, considering defensive forwarding principles.

## Next Steps

*   Ted Lemon to publish SNAC Simple draft -06 reflecting the changes discussed in the meeting.
*   Schedule further interim meetings to address remaining open issues.
*   Poll the mailing list to determine the best time for interim meetings.
