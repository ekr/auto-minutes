<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 22 Jul 2024 22:30</p>
<h1>mops</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Media Operations (MOPS) working group meeting covered updates on working group documents, an overview of the Media over Quick (MoQ) working group, an analysis of Real-Time Communication (RTC) application protocol usage, and the operational impacts of network overlays on media platforms. The meeting concluded with a discussion about adopting a draft outlining these impacts within the MOPS working group.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working Group Document Updates:</strong>  Updates were provided on the status of the extended reality application use case document and the Treatian document, both progressing through the RFC Editor and IESG queues respectively.</li>
<li><strong>MoQ Update (Alan Frindell, Meta):</strong>
<ul>
<li>MoQ aims to unify low-latency video conferencing and high-scalability live streaming using Quick and WebTransport.</li>
<li>Key components include Media Over Quick Transport (pub-sub), low overhead container format, and a catalog for manifest-like functionality.</li>
<li>Design decisions include an object model (tracks, groups, objects), relay architecture, and transport mapping flexibility (streams vs. datagrams).</li>
<li>Prioritization mechanisms involve subscriber and publisher input, inter-track and intra-track (fidelity vs. freshness) priorities.</li>
<li>Multiple implementations are in development, with interoperability events planned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Analysis of RTC Application Protocol Usage (Wu, Penn, Peking, Zau):</strong>
<ul>
<li>RTC applications often deviate from RFC standards, using proprietary extensions and multiplexing protocols.</li>
<li>FaceTime, Discord, Zoom, Messenger, and WhatsApp were analyzed on iOS.</li>
<li>Key findings include protocol multiplexing in a single UDP session (Quick, RTP, STUN), proprietary RTP header extensions, filler packets (Zoom), and custom STUN implementations.</li>
<li>Messenger was found to be closest to RFC standards.</li>
<li>The lack of standards compliance hinders code sharing, monitoring, and research.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Operational Impacts of Network Overlays (Glenn Deen, Comcast):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Network curabilizations (e.g., Apple Private Relay) modify network policies (DNS, routing) and affect CDN cache selection, geolocation, and authentication.</li>
<li>Changes in routing paths introduce latency, conflicting with the demand for low-latency live sports streaming.</li>
<li>Applications often lack transparency regarding the network policies applied by overlays.</li>
<li>Potential mitigation strategies include best practices guides, studies on the operational impact of privacy enhancements, and collaboration with other working groups.</li>
<li>HTTP vs. HTTPS routing differences were discussed, with emphasis on the potential for unexpected behavior due to Private Relay applying only to HTTP in some cases.</li>
<li>The importance of both platform and network overlay implementers to follow standards for media transport and peering was discussed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>MOPS Working Group Adoption:</strong> The MOPS working group agreed, via a show of hands, to adopt the draft on unexpected consequences of network overlays as a work item to flush out the list of consequences.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Glenn Deen will continue working on the &quot;Unexpected Consequences of Network Overlays&quot; draft, incorporating feedback from the MOPS working group and potential co-authors.</li>
<li>Explore further collaboration with other relevant IETF working groups to address the challenges posed by network overlays.</li>
</ul>
