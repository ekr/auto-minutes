## Summary

The AVTcore meeting covered several topics including closing media type registries, RTP over QUIC, HEVC profile for WebRTC, RTCP messages for temporal spatial resolution, Haptics, RTP header extensions, the Advanced Professional Video Codec (APV), and J2K. Several drafts are approaching last call.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Closing Media Type Registries:** Discussion around Magnus's draft for closing the media type version agenda registry. IANA's review raised questions about dependencies with other drafts. It was decided to move forward with working group last call, with adjustments made to other drafts as needed.
*   **RTP over QUIC (ROQ):** Mattis presented updates on buffering for unknown flow IDs, RTCP bandwidth limits, implementation status, and interop tests. There was a discussion about the usefulness of transporting RTCP over streams versus datagrams. Jahed suggested potentially not caring about RTCP bandwidth limits. Magnus pointed out the importance of correctly configuring minimal distance for non-early traffic.
*   **HEVC Profile for WebRTC:** Spencer provided an update on implementation status in Chrome Canary and Safari Tech Preview, highlighting limitations and bugs. There was a discussion regarding the potential issue with receive-only or send-only codecs, which needs further testing and clarification when the safari gets synced with chrome.
*   **RTCP Messages for Temporal Spatial Resolution:** Lena presented on behalf of Yonghe regarding RTCP messages for temporal spatial resolution, outlining the draft's history, impact, effectiveness, and implementation. The authors requested working group last call to be started, which was approved.
*   **Haptics:** Hensinyang requested working group last call for the Haptics draft. With no objections it was approved.
*   **RTP Header Extensions:** John proposed a new RTP header extension for absolute capture timestamp. Colin supported further processing, suggesting the creation of a working group document.
*   **Advanced Professional Video Codec (APV):** Yong presented the RTP payload format for APV and plans for submitting it to the independent series RFC.
*   **J2K:** A media type parameter which allowed multi-tile images to be transmitted as multiple single tile images over independent sessions has been removed in this revision. The document is considered ready for working group last call.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Closing Media Type Registries:** Move to working group last call. J2K should remove the reference to the RTP payload media format type registry. Magnus will send specific sentence needing removal to the J2K authors.
*   **RTP over QUIC (ROQ):** Mattis will create a PR addressing the RTCP bandwidth limits discussion.
*   **HEVC Profile for WebRTC:** Spencer will continue to work on the spec and test Safari synced with chrome.
*   **RTCP Messages for Temporal Spatial Resolution:** Move to working group last call.
*   **Haptics:** Move to working group last call.
*   **RTP Header Extensions:** John will create an internet draft describing the proposed header extension.
*   **Advanced Professional Video Codec (APV):** Yong will publish the codec and submit the draft to the independent series.
*   **J2K:** After quick revision, move to working group last call.
*   **Region of Interest:** Encourage those interested to express support on the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Schedule last calls for Closing Media Type Registries, Haptics, RTCP Messages for Temporal Spatial Resolution, and J2K.
*   Authors of the drafts should prepare the documents to be ready for last call.
*   Revise drafts to reflect the points discussed at this meeting.
