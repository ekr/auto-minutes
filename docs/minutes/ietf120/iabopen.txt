## Summary

The IAB Open meeting provided updates on IAB activities, including mature documents nearing RFC status, technical program updates (E-Impact and EDM), and liaison activities. A detailed liaison report was presented on MOG (Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group). The meeting also introduced two upcoming workshops: one focused on AI and copyright, and another on the future of network management operations. An invited talk by Bill Murdoch on community networks in indigenous communities in Manitoba, Canada, highlighted the challenges and successes in providing internet access to remote areas.
