<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 26 Jul 2024 00:00</p>
<h1>extra</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This was a joint session of the &quot;extra&quot; and &quot;mailmaid&quot; working groups. The first part of the meeting focused on the &quot;extra&quot; working group, reviewing the status of several documents and discussing the future of the group. The bulk of the session was then dedicated to &quot;mailmaid&quot; topics, including presentations and discussions of proposed work items related to email usability and security. A charter discussion regarding implementation commitments also took place, followed by a call for adoption of client ID drafts.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<h3>Extra Documents</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>6855 BIS and JMAP Access:</strong> Both documents are considered &quot;cooked&quot; and ready to proceed.</li>
<li><strong>Message Limit:</strong> A revised ID is needed; Alexi to revise.</li>
<li><strong>Calendars JMAP:</strong> Waiting for IANA review; author unresponsive.</li>
<li><strong>Working Group Status:</strong> The working group will remain open until existing work is completed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mailmaid: Wrong Recipient Feature</h3>
<ul>
<li>John Levine presented a draft proposing a &quot;wrong recipient&quot; feature, similar to the &quot;unsubscribe&quot; mechanism, using a POST request to a designated URL.</li>
<li>The goal is to allow recipients to easily notify senders that they received mail intended for someone else, particularly useful for transactional mail.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about tying the mechanism to a web interface and potential for misuse by phishers.</li>
<li>There was general support for the idea, and an action item was created to call for adoption on the mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mailmaid: Expires Header Field</h3>
<ul>
<li>John Levine presented a draft reviving the &quot;Expires&quot; header field, specifying when a message is no longer relevant.</li>
<li>Discussions revolved around the meaning and interpretation of the &quot;Expires&quot; header, and whether it should trigger any specific actions by MUAs or MTAs.</li>
<li>John Klensin offered to incorporate the changes directly into the AS document.</li>
<li>Murray raised concerns about non-agreement over what expires means.</li>
<li>Ultimately, the group agreed to adopt the document and further discuss semantics on the mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mailmaid: Unicode Email Addresses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Art presented a draft proposing a BCP to define a safer character repertoire for provisioning and validating human addresses.</li>
<li>John Klensin expressed concerns about creating competing standards and suggested updating the existing SMTP UTF-8 specifications instead.</li>
<li>A conversation between Art, John Klensin, Murray, and the chairs will be organized to hash out a potential plan.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mailmaid: Charter Discussion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Concerns regarding the charter requirement for implementation commitments before adopting standards-track documents were discussed.</li>
<li>The requirement was intended to prevent the working group from spending time on documents that would not be implemented.</li>
<li>There was general agreement to maintain the existing charter language.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Client ID Draft Adoption</h3>
<ul>
<li>A request was made to adopt the client ID drafts, which have been implemented by several vendors and open-source projects.</li>
<li>The group supported adopting these drafts, and a call was made to adopt it on the list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alexi:</strong> Revise the &quot;Message Limit&quot; draft.</li>
<li><strong>Murray:</strong> Submit both 6855 and Jamip axis to IETF last call</li>
<li><strong>John Levine:</strong> Call for adoption of the &quot;wrong recipient&quot; draft on the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>John Klensin:</strong> Collaborate with John Levine to incorporate &quot;Expires&quot; header changes into the AS document.</li>
<li><strong>Art:</strong> Organize a conversation with John Klensin, Murray, and the chairs to discuss the Unicode email address draft.</li>
<li><strong>Michael:</strong> Make a call for adoption for the client ID drafts on the list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Discuss the semantics of the &quot;Expires&quot; header on the mailing list.</li>
<li>Hash out a plan for addressing the Unicode email address issue through discussions and subsequent updates on the mailing list.</li>
<li>Continue discussions about the client ID drafts and move towards adoption.</li>
</ul>
