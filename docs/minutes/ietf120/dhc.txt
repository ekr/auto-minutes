## Summary

This meeting of the DHC working group covered the advancement of RFC 8415 to Internet Standard, a presentation on DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 relays, and a discussion on the future of the working group. The working group decided to send RFC 8415 to the IESG in two weeks. It also discussed a draft about DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 and provided feedback to the author. Finally, the participants discussed the security aspects of DHCP and the future of the working group, deciding to keep it open for future work.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RFC 8415 (DHCPv6):** Discussion focused on advancing the document to Internet Standard. Clarifications made regarding UDP ports and the IA address option in version 05.
*   **DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 Relays:** Claudio presented a draft proposing DHCPv4 encapsulation within DHCPv6 at the relay agent, addressing topology discovery challenges in radio access networks. The discussion included concerns about broadcast traffic and unicast renewals, and how the relay agent needs to handle them.
*   **Adoption of DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 draft:** The working group considered adopting the draft after a couple more revisions addressing the comments provided.
*   **RAN Use Case:**  The relevance and placement of the RAN (Radio Access Network) use case within the DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 draft was debated. Consensus reached to move it to an appendix.
*   **Working Group Future:**  The discussion shifted to the future of the DHC working group, with a decision to keep it open due to continued relevance and new use cases.
*   **WPAD and DHCP Security:** Josh Cohen raised concerns about WPAD security, specifically related to DHCP, and the lack of root trust. The discussion covered authentication issues, rogue DHCP servers, and mitigation techniques like DHCP guard and SAVI.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **RFC 8415:** Send the document to the IESG in two weeks.
*   **DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 draft:** Claudio to update the draft based on the feedback, especially regarding handling of broadcast traffic, unicast renewals and RAN use case.
*   **DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 draft:** Move the RAN specific use case to an appendix.
