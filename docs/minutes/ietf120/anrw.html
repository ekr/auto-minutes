<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Apply Networking Research Workshop (ANRW) 2024 kicked off with a welcome message, followed by a keynote from Sharad Gargwal of Microsoft on leveraging AI/ML for 5G and 6G systems. The workshop then transitioned into a measurement session featuring two papers. The first paper discussed the challenges of HTTP/3's Extensible Prioritization Scheme (EPS) in real-world deployments, and the second paper introduced the concept of the observer effect in computer networks and its implications for network measurement.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Potential Action Item:</strong> Investigate the possibility of standardizing the observer factor calculation to aid in the design of future measurement protocols within the IETF.</li>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Applied Networking Research Workshop (anrw) session featured three presentations covering diverse topics: location-aware advertising in ENICAS IP networks, empirical characterization of Anycast convergence time, and diffusing computation for loop-free short-path routing.  A fourth presentation covered traffic management focusing on Quality of Experience.  The first presentation investigated regional trends and selective announcements in ENICAS routing. The second presentation empirically measured Anycast convergence times from an end-host perspective. The third presentation introduced a new routing protocol, &quot;Dare,&quot; designed to improve the efficiency of diffusing computations. The fourth presentation looked at better Quality of Experience traffic management. Each presentation was followed by a Q&amp;A session.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>

</ul>
</li>
