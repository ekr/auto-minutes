## Summary

The DMM working group session covered several topics including:
*   Updates on the "Framework for Transport Slices in Mobile Networks" draft and its relationship to the TEAS working group.
*   Discussion of the "Computing Aware Traffic Steering Consideration for Mobile User Plane Architecture" draft and enhancements for service instance routing.
*   Presentation of a new draft on "Mobile Traffic Steering" addressing end-to-end path optimization and advanced use cases.
*   A discussion regarding the application of an end marker in data networks when using distributed UPFs.
*   A review of a prior adoption call and new updates related to work on Distributed and Autonomous Networks for 6G.
*   An introduction of a potential new work item on enabling emergency calling over Wi-Fi networks.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Transport Slices:** Differentiation between the DMM draft on transport slices with attachment circuits and TEAS drafts focusing on proximate attachment circuits was discussed. Coordination with the TEAS working group was identified as an action item. The question of the relationship to transport-aware mobility also came up again and it was decided to add text to differentiate between them in the document.
*   **Computing Aware Traffic Steering:** Discussion focused on the definition and usage of CSID (cast service ID) and its relationship to TEID. Clarification on the meaning of "session information" was requested. There was also discussion on the distinction between segments and services.
*   **Mobile Traffic Steering:** Clarification was requested on the use case for "non-routable IP" (misunderstood as not routable). The applicability of LISP was raised and the draft authors committed to comparing their work to LISP and explaining why it is (or is not) sufficient. The need for coordination with 3GPP was raised.
*   **6G Network Architecture:** Questions arose concerning the relationship of presented work on distributed and autonomous networks for 6G with the 3GPP standards and future plans.
*   **End Marker in Distributed UPF:** Questions were asked about how important the end marking mechanism is today as networks continue to improve. Suggestions were made about considering alternatives such as multipath TCP and to ensure work is generalized to be access agnostic (more than just 3GPP).
*   **Emergency Calling over Wi-Fi:** Discussion of new possible work related to emergency services over Wi-Fi, and related potential work items, including Passpoint profile standardization and location reporting was discussed.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Transport Slices:**
    *   Action: Clarify the attachment circuit use case in the draft.
    *   Action: Post the draft to the TEAS mailing list and solicit feedback.
    *   Action: Add text to the draft to clarify the relationship between the DMM transport slices draft and mobility aware drafts in the routing area.
*   **Computing Aware Traffic Steering:**
    *   Action: Clarify the definition and usage of CSID and its relationship to TEID in the document.
*   **Mobile Traffic Steering:**
    *   Action: Compare the mobile traffic steering work to LISP and document the differences in the draft.
    *   Action: Engage with 3GPP to determine if the proposed work aligns with their roadmap.
*   **6G Network Architecture:**
    *   Action: The group should check the DMM charter and add a milestone if needed, with regard to distributed and autonomous networks for 6G.
    *   Action: Authors of Distributed and Autonomous Networks for 6G were encouraged to clarify the purpose of their document related to that call, so they are not confused about the boundary for the draft.
*   **Emergency Calling over Wi-Fi:**
    *   Action: Further discussion is needed to determine a working group where this work would fit.
*  **Other:**
    *   Action: The DMM chairs and authors were to work with authors to address any concerns about the boundary for the draft and if they should supply a code in their proposal.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address action items and revise drafts.
*   Continued discussion on the mailing list for open items.
*   Follow-up discussions with related working groups (TEAS).
*   Possible hackathon to demonstrate concepts and technologies for emergency calling.
