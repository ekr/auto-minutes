## Summary

The IETF Wish Working Group met to discuss the status of the Whip and WHEP drafts, a proposal for a new reconnect event for WHEP, and potential future work. The group discussed feedback from IESG and IANA reviews on the Whip draft and a proposal for incorporating SCATI-certified events into WHEP. They also explored the possibility of collaborating with MPEG DASH on integrating WebRTC playback into DASH manifests.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Whip Draft Status:** Updates on IESG and IANA feedback, with Sergio addressing comments related to HTTP best practices. Francis indicated that editorial changes require a new version.
*   **WHEP Draft Status:** Backporting changes from Whip to WHEP, and the potential for incorporating SCATI-certified events for client-side ad insertion.
*   **SCATI-certified Events Proposal:** Dapang Liu proposed adding SCATI-certified events to WHEP for signaling client-side ad insertion.  The group discussed whether to include this directly in the WHEP spec or as an extension.
*   **WebRTC/MPEG DASH Integration:** Sergio raised the possibility of integrating WebRTC playback into MPEG DASH and proposed collaborating with the DASH Industry Forum (DASH-IF), now part of SVTA. Discussion focused on identifying appropriate experts and determining if this should be addressed in the core DASH spec or an extension.
*   **Reconnect Event Proposal:** Dapang Liu presented a proposal for a new "Reconnect" server-sent event in WHEP, allowing the server to signal clients to reconnect, potentially to a different endpoint.  Discussion focused on whether the reconnect event should include a configurable URL and the implications for clients that may not support the event.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Whip Draft:** Create a new version of the Whip draft to address editorial comments (BCP 14 code capitalization). Sergio will do so after returning from PTO on August 19th. Sean will hold off on sending Murray a push until the new version is created.
*   **WebRTC/MPEG DASH Integration:** Sean will cue Marie up to initiate a liaison statement with SVTA. Sergio will pick internally to see if he can find the right people to send the two to.
*   **Reconnect Event Proposal:** Include a configurable URL in the Reconnect event. Dapang will proceed with this approach.
*   **WHEP Draft:** Remove topics with little feedback (multiple language support, metadata) from the target list.

## Next Steps

*   Sergio will create a new version of the Whip draft after August 19th.
*   Sean will contact Marie regarding a liaison statement with SVTA (formerly DASH-IF).
*   Sergio will update the WHEP draft with the SCATI certified events and Reconnect event with configurable URL, aiming for a September/October timeframe.
*   Aim for working group last call on WHEP in September/October.
*   Discuss outstanding items at the next IETF meeting in Dublin in November.
