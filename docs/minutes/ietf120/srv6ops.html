<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 22 Jul 2024 22:30</p>
<h1>srv6ops</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The first meeting of the srv6ops working group focused on defining the scope and charter, as well as hearing presentations from operators Verizon and China Unicom, and Rakuten Mobile, about their SRv6 deployments and operational experiences. The meeting also included reviews of submitted drafts related to SRv6 seed allocation and protection strategies. A key theme was the importance of operational considerations and avoiding overlap with the spring working group.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Charter Review:</strong> The working group reviewed its charter, emphasizing the focus on operational aspects of SRv6 networks. IPV6 generic or SRM/SRv6 common topics are out of scope. Focus is on operator experiences, operational challenges, and guidance.</li>
<li><strong>AD Guidance:</strong> Jim, the Area Director, emphasized the importance of adhering to the charter and avoiding overlap with other working groups, particularly Spring. He clarified that srv6ops is not a replacement or extension of Spring.</li>
<li><strong>Verizon Presentation:</strong> Luay Jalil from Verizon discussed Verizon's motivations for adopting SRv6, including simplifying the protocol stack, advanced traffic engineering, end-to-end connectivity, and Linux OS compatibility.</li>
<li><strong>China Unicom Presentation:</strong> Shenzhen from China Unicom presented a use case and requirements for SRv6 in cloud environments, highlighting challenges related to SRv6 support on cloud devices and the need for virtual routers supporting SRv6 within the cloud. Due to audio issues, the presentation was cut short with a summary.</li>
<li><strong>Rakuten Mobile Presentation:</strong> Akaa Shigrawal from Rakuten Mobile shared Rakuten's SRv6 implementation journey, including design choices, IGP design, and migration strategy. He presented significant performance improvements and reduced service-affecting incidents after SRv6 deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Inter-domain Deployment Considerations:</strong> Yisong Liu from China Mobile presented considerations for SRv6 inter-domain deployment. This included co-existence with MPLS networks, traffic engineering techniques, data plane visualization, addressing planning, traffic steering and protection mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>SRv6 Seed Allocation:</strong> Zhu Yongqing from Tung Telecom presented a draft on optimizing SRv6 SID allocation, addressing issues related to fragmented address space and security policy enforcement.</li>
<li><strong>SRv6 Protection Practices:</strong> A draft on deployment practices suitable for different SRv6 protection scenarios was presented, including different pointers for protection and Interop test data from Channel Mobile.</li>
<li><strong>Transitioning to SRv6:</strong> A question was raised about transitioning from brownfield environments to SRv6. There was acknowledgment that this is a helpful area to document.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document Transition Guidance:</strong> The working group will consider developing a document providing guidance on transitioning to SRv6 in brownfield environments.</li>
<li><strong>Refine Telemetry Requirements:</strong> The working group will provide input to the spring working group on telemetry and observability parameters relevant to SRv6 operations.</li>
<li><strong>Address BFD and MTU issues:</strong> The working group acknowledged there may be MDU/MTU discovery issues and will investigate and potentially fix them.</li>
<li><strong>Limit Authors:</strong>  New documents should limit the number of authors to five to avoid problems at the end of the working group.</li>
<li><strong>Rationale for Guidance:</strong> The authors of the draft on SRv6 protection practices were asked to add rationale to the recommendations made.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to address feedback from the working group and revise their drafts.</li>
<li>The working group to further define the scope and content of the document on transitioning to SRv6.</li>
<li>Mailing list to be used for continued discussions and Q&amp;A following the meeting.</li>
<li>Chandron from the last presentation can present it in the next meeting.</li>
</ul>
