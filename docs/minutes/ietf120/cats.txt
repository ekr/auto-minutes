## Summary

The CATS working group meeting covered several topics including use case updates, framework updates, compute modeling and metrics, and applicability to mid-haul networks. Discussions focused on refining existing documents, adding new use cases, defining metrics for computing-aware traffic steering, and addressing security concerns. A new co-chair, Med Boucadair, was announced to replace Adrian Farrel in Dublin.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Use Case Updates:**
    *   Updates to the CATS problem statement, use cases, and requirements document were presented, including new use cases for CDN, cloud rendering, and internet vehicles.
    *   Terminology changes regarding "service" and "computing service" were discussed, and consensus was reached on updated definitions.
    *   Deployment testbeds in China for CDN 4K video delivery and cloud rendering were presented, along with preliminary results.
    *   A use case for high-speed internet for vehicles was introduced, focusing on remote driving scenarios and the need for low latency, high bandwidth, and stable connectivity.
    *   Discussion on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) use cases, focusing on context-aware navigation and cluster-based MAC protocols, with a focus on the requirements of ADAS.
    *   Industrial Internet use cases were discussed, focusing on deterministic management of computing power and network resources for applications like industrial robots and virtual cloud termination.
*   **Framework Updates:**
    *   Updates to the CATS framework document were presented, addressing comments from the working group adoption call and identifying areas for further development.
    *   Discussion on aligning the framework with the use cases being prototyped and experimented with.
*   **Compute Modeling and Metrics:**
    *   Updates to the draft on computing modeling description were presented, focusing on defining computing-related metrics and how to use them in the CATS domain.
    *   Design principles for metric definition were discussed, including simplicity, scalability, interoperability, stability, and accuracy.
    *   A hierarchical framework for defining metrics was proposed, with three levels: raw metrics, normalized metrics, and fully normalized metrics.
    *   Discussion on Kubernetes metrics and architecture.
    *   A draft on CATS metric definition was introduced, proposing an initial framework for defining metrics.
*   **Mid-Haul Networks Applicability:**
    *   The applicability of CATS to mid-haul networks was analyzed, focusing on the F1 interface in 3GPP terminology and the use of CATS for traffic steering between distributed units (DU) and centralized units (CU).

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Kehan to welcome discussion on list.
*   **Action Item:** Paul to provide suggested text for merging the ITS use case into the use case document to the authors of the use case document.
*   **Action Item:** Photo to review and respond to Carlos Bernal's comment about the industrial requirements draft in the Deadnet working group via email.
*   **Action Item:** Ming to add specific text to sections 3.3, 4.1, 4.5, and 5 of the framework document.
*   **Action Item:** Working group members to provide feedback on the compute modeling and metrics drafts.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs will talk to the AD to discuss the best way to communicate with the O-RAN Alliance.
*   **Action Item:** Linda to send a note to the mailing list with a pointer to the IDR draft on the metadata past attribute.
*   **Action Item:** Group to consider Security issues.
*   **Decision:** The chairs will talk to the AD and work out what the best way to communicate with O-RAN is

## Next Steps

*   Authors to continue refining documents based on feedback.
*   Working group to discuss and agree on default metrics for CATS.
*   Explore the interplay between the ORAN orchestration framework the SMO, and how it could interact with the CATS entities
*   Prepare new versions of drafts for the next IETF meeting.
*   Push out new revisions more often, in order to provide cleaner reading materials for the drafts.
