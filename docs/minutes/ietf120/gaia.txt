## Summary

This session covered a range of topics related to networking and access, including tribal broadband boot camps, concise binary object representation (CBOR) for web and DNS management, and a panel discussion on the opportunities and challenges of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks. The discussion highlighted the importance of sustainable internet access, the role of international law in governing new technologies, and the economic and technical considerations for deploying and operating these networks.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Tribal Broadband Boot Camps:**
    *   The boot camps provide training and support to tribal nations in deploying broadband networks.
    *   Focus areas include wireless technology, fiber optics, network solutions, business models, and funding cycles.
    *   The boot camps have created a valuable network of tribal representatives who share experiences and resources.
*   **Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR):**
    *   CBOR is a binary data serialization format that offers advantages over JSON in terms of size and efficiency.
    *   CBOR can be used to reduce the size of web objects and DNS messages, potentially decreasing latency.
    *   Domain-specific conversion techniques and name component referencing can further improve compression ratios.
*   **LEO Satellite Networks:**
    *   LEO satellite networks, such as Starlink, offer the potential to provide internet access to underserved areas.
    *   The economic viability of LEO networks remains a key question, as well as the role of deep-pocketed investments.
    *   Landing rights, regulatory compliance, and competition among providers are important considerations.
    *   International law and multi-stakeholder governance can play a role in ensuring sustainable and equitable access to LEO-based internet services.
    *   Capacity building and promoting awareness of data privacy and security issues are crucial for responsible deployment of LEO networks.
*   **Interplay with Existing Infrastructure**
    *   It was broadly agreed that LEO satellite networks shouldn't completely replace current terrestrial infrastructure like fiber networks, but should serve as complimentary technologies.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   Nalini Elkins offered free IPv6 training to the tribal broadband boot camps.
*   Discussions on CBOR DNS message format are planned for IETF 122 in Dublin.

## Next Steps

*   Continue to monitor the economic and technical developments of LEO satellite networks.
*   Explore the role of the IETF in addressing the challenges and opportunities of LEO-based internet access.
*   Further investigate the application of international law and multi-stakeholder governance in the context of LEO networks.
*   Reach out to stakeholders, including Starlink, to discuss how access can be provided without disrupting connectivity and disabling government access.
