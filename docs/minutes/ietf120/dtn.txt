## Summary

The DTN working group meeting at IETF 120 covered BPSEC COSE security context status, EID patterns, network management updates, COAP over BP, bundle and bundle encapsulation, and a rechartering discussion. The group discussed the implications of moving to the internet area and the need to broaden the charter to include delay and disruption-tolerant networking beyond bundle protocol.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **BPSEC COSE Security Context:**
    *   Editorial changes were made, including minimum interoperability for algorithms.
    *   One functional change involved wrapping a parameter in a byte string to reduce the burden on BPSEC security block processing.
    *   A second short working group last call was suggested due to the change in the encoded form.
    *   A document shepherd is needed.

*   **EID Patterns:**
    *   The goal is to standardize a way to structure an EID set beyond simple enumeration.
    *   Use cases include secure processing, routing, forwarding, authorization, and human-friendly encoding.
    *   Discussions included scheme-specific part types of patterns, particularly for IPN and DTN schemes.
    *   Deferring DTN scheme patterns to a separate document was suggested.
    *   Concerns were raised about the complexity and potential overlap detection problems in routing tables.
    *   A suggestion was made to add language that caveats the matching for the DTN scheme as the most generic possible matching.

*   **DTNMA Updates:**
    *   The DTMA draft is in the editor's queue.
    *   The AMM/ADM document has been refined, and the YANG-encoded ADM module is separated.
    *   The ARI document has updates, and the AMP document has been revived.
    *   Discussions included hierarchy in namespaces, ACL ADM, and ARI reference resolution.

*   **COAP over BP:**
    *   Updates include a new section on encapsulating bundles and specifying the lifetime field.
    *   For bundles encapsulating responses, the destination endpoint ID should be identical to the source node ID.
    *   Aggregation of COAP messages in a single bundle was discussed.
    *   The group discussed considerations for congestion control with non-messages.
    *   Recommendations were made on using the BP creation timestamp to determine the order of notifications.
    *   ARPA namespace registration and securing COAP over BP with OSCore were also discussed.
    *   Suggestions included BP.arpa and IPN.BP.arpa registration.
    *   Considerations were raised about aggregating CoAP messages into the same bundle and tying them to the destination EID.

*   **Bundle in Bundle Encapsulation:**
    *   Bundle in bundle encapsulation can serve as a mechanism for building service provider data DTN networks. It also provides for backward compatibility with BPV6.
    *   Bide is a Janus-sort of device, it faces in two directions. It's a convergence there protocol.
    *   There are concerns about some overhead due to the additional header.
    *   Questions raised about retransmission time, number of bundles in flight, lost acknowledgements.

*   **Rechartering Discussion:**
    *   The working group has moved to the internet area.
    *   Broadening the scope of the charter to include general delay and disruption-tolerant networking was discussed.
    *   Maintain the focus on bundle protocol, the management piece, and addressing new technologies like QUIC over long latencies.
    *   Topics for an updated charter include routing architectures for constellation networks, applying protocols to underwater communication, and alignment with CCSDS.
    *   Considerations about the whole IP stack not just QUIC.
    *   Ensure the best way to judge and achieve consensus is on technical merit.
    *   Adding considerations and applicability statements.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Find a document shepherd for the BPSEC COSE security context draft.
*   **Action Item:** Brian Sipo to update the EID patterns draft to address the open issues about the DTN scheme
*   **Decision:** Conduct a working group last call on the BPSEC COSE security context draft.
*   **Decision:** Conduct a call for adoption on the EID patterns draft after addressing open issues.
*   **Action Item:** Carlos Gomez to review the ARPA registration discussion and update the COAP over BP draft.
*   **Action Item:** Propose rechartering to the mailing list for further discussion.

## Next Steps

*   Publish the BPSEC COSE security context draft after a successful last call.
*   Advance the EID patterns draft towards working group adoption.
*   Continue refining the DTNMA-related documents.
*   Gather feedback on the rechartering proposal from the mailing list and prepare a revised charter draft.
