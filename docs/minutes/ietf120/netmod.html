<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 22 Jul 2024 20:00</p>
<h1>netmod</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The NetMod working group session at IETF 120 in Vancouver covered a range of topics, including document updates, post-last call discussions, and new draft proposals. Key discussions revolved around Yang module versioning, system-defined configuration updates, common Yang data models for scheduling, and approaches to managing device configurations. The session also addressed the future of Yang, including potential versions 1.2 and 2.0.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common Yang Data Types:</strong>  The working group sought a volunteer editor to finalize the &quot;6991 bis&quot; document, which has been delayed in the publication process.</li>
<li><strong>Common Interface Extension &amp; Sub-interface:</strong>  The status of these expired drafts was discussed, with a plan to get them resubmitted for last call after addressing final edits.</li>
<li><strong>Yang Module Versioning:</strong>  Updates on two drafts related to Yang module versioning and semantic versioning were presented. Authors requested a new working group last call.</li>
<li><strong>Yang File Naming Convention:</strong> Per presented an experimental draft to standardize file naming with YANG semantic versioning, there was a discussion about whether it should be proposed standard instead.</li>
<li><strong>System-Defined Configuration Update:</strong> The working group reviewed updates to the draft, focusing on issues raised during the last call, including what needs to be copied from system to running and merge behavior. Another last call was decided.</li>
<li><strong>Common Scheduling Yang Model:</strong> The authors presented updates to the common scheduling data model and requested working group review, along with an early review by the Yang doctors.</li>
<li><strong>Immutable Flag:</strong> The group discussed clarifications on the immutable flag and its impact on NetConf and RESTCONF specifications. A potential liaison with 3GPP was considered.</li>
<li><strong>Yang Full Embed:</strong> A proposal for reusing device-level modules at the network level was presented. Concerns were raised about complexity and potential conflicts with existing Yang mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Device Configuration as a Service:</strong> An approach to managing device configurations as a service through the SDM controller was presented, sparking discussion on conflict management and inventory alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Yang Next:</strong> Ken Watsen presented his work on Yang next, including refactoring the existing Yang specification. The discussion focused on whether to pursue Yang 1.2 and/or Yang 2.0, the approach, and the benefits to the community.</li>
<li><strong>Large Scale Management:</strong> The BBF presented a Liaison letter on scaling issues of YANG modules with the suggestion that certain data nodes can be moved deeper into the YANG tree.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Common Yang Data Types:</strong> The working group will seek a volunteer editor to finalize the &quot;6991 bis&quot; document.</li>
<li><strong>Yang File Naming Convention:</strong> This document will be considered for adoption as a working group document and proceed toward a proposed standard rather than experimental RFC.</li>
<li><strong>System-Defined Configuration Update:</strong> Another working group last call will be initiated.</li>
<li><strong>Immutable Flag:</strong> Rob Wilson volunteered to draft a liaison statement to 3GPP regarding the document's status.</li>
<li><strong>Yang Full Embed:</strong> The authors will work offline with the authors of packages to see whether or not they can leverage the same mechanism or a slight modification of it</li>
<li><strong>Yang Next:</strong> Kent Watsen will prepare a document outlining the motivation and objectives for Yang next to facilitate further discussion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors of the discussed drafts will incorporate feedback from the meeting and submit updated versions.</li>
<li>The working group will continue discussions on the mailing list, particularly regarding the device configuration service approach.</li>
<li>The Chairs will send out information on the various action items discussed.</li>
</ul>
