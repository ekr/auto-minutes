    *   Addressed performance concerns related to retrieving all YANG schemas.
*   **Sustainability Insights:**
    *   Presented work on collecting sustainability metrics from networks using YANG push instead of SSH.
    *   Focused on measuring power draw and correlating it with energy mix for life cycle analysis.
*   **ScrumPro for RTC:**
    *   Showed how ScrumPro can reduce latency in RTC applications by providing faster feedback on bandwidth changes.
    *   Utilized Docker and Linux TC to simulate network environments.
*   **ILNP Kernel Debugging:**
    *   Presented successful debugging of a FreeBSD kernel for ILNP, demonstrating multi-homing.
    *   Signaling between hosts using ICMP was validated.
*   **Post-Quantum IoT Shields:**
    *   Discussed securing IoT devices against quantum computers.
    *   Proposed a repository for developers to implement post-quantum algorithms.
    *   Presented mesh and hub-based designs for encryption.
*   **DNSSEC Enhancements:**
    *   Explored implementation approaches for Merkel Tree Ladder Mode to minimize the size impact of PQC signature schemes.
    *   Discussed the need for input from implementers and operators.
*   **Responsible DNS Integration:**
    *   Examined new use cases for DNS domain names in blockchain and Web3 applications.
    *   Proposed a draft providing guidance for responsible DNS integration.
    *   Addressed challenges related to the domain name lifecycle.
*   **Congestion Control Testing:**
    *   Presented results from testing the Careful Resume draft with different QUIC implementations.
    *   Observed variations in congestion window despite a sender-side change.
*   **Low Latency Cryptography:**
    *   Presented Arayan for encryption and hashing, comparing it to AES-GCM and SHA-256.
    *   Arayan showed effectiveness when keys are frequently updated and message lengths are short.
*   **Digital Map Generation:**
    *   Demonstrated using IETF topology modules to represent real IP operator networks.
    *   Collected data from multi-vendor labs using OpenConfig and NetConf.
    *   Mapped device models to IETF network-wide models.
*   **Anomaly Detection (Antagonist):**
    *   Presented a label store for network anomalies to enable operators to discover issues early.
    *   Validated a semantic for exchanging data and a lifecycle for anomaly detection.
*   **YANG Push Publisher Validation:**
    *   Validated different YANG push publishers against YANG Push Receiver.
    *   Tested integrations with message brokers.
*   **Thread Protocol Enhancements:**
    *   Demonstrated a TCP listener running on a Thread board without using the serial port, utilizing DNS service discovery.
*   **L4S Interoperability:**
    *   Showcased L4S congestion control architecture including congestion control implementation, network signaling and receiver feedback.
    *   Integrated a new open source congestion control algorithm called UDP Prague into IPRF2.
*   **TLS Attestation:**
    *   Explored three options to incorporate attestation to the TLS protocol to ensure guarantees even if endpoints are compromised.
    *   Discussions on attesting more than just at a station, needing to define what is actually being attested.
*   **DNS Enhancements:**
    *   SVCB processing by OR alias mode processing by the unbound resolver.
    *   Zone version EDNS option in NS1 which reports from which zone the answer came and which version of the zone.
    *   Generalized DNS notification which automatic synchronization of the delegation information between a child and parent.
*   **PQ Interoperability:**
    *   Continued interoperability testing of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.
    *   Implemented a GitHub action for automatically testing new PQ algorithm implementations.
    *   Created an adjacent artifact for making testing more crypto agile.
    *   New members from Major Telecom of Taiwan joined.
*   **Open PGP Signature Verification:**
    *   Created a wrapper that transforms GPGV into SOPV for standardized Open PGP verification.
*   **VCON Processing with Scrappy:**
    *   Implemented the SCIT-REST API to audit every V-Con transformation and place it onto a ledger.
*   **SCIT: supply chain integrity, transparency and trust:**
    *   End-to-end client code for skid issuance, use case application engineering for data security
    *   New skid issues became clearer that low-level cryptographic principles to lots and lots of broad use cases needs some small but clever glue
    *   It is absolutely possible for regular ordinary people who write regular ordinary code to use skit for their sort of software supply chain, data supply chain, and provisioning.
*   **QUIC for Deep Space:**
    *   Working on Deep Space QUIC, Quinn exposed more transport config parameters than most quick stacks.
    *   Modified Nico and IAO Quick to expose transport parameters for deep space use cases.
*   **Interface to Innetwork Functions:**
    *   Implemented a framework to enable intelligent management for mobile objects.
    *   Demonstrated intent-based networking for software-defined vehicles.
*   **VCON Generalization to CDDL:**
    *   Created Seabor version of V-Cons.
    *   Added a CDDL schema spec for seabor and testing around redaction of the V-Cons.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **DNS Integration Draft:** Incorporate feedback into the next version of the DNS integration draft. The DNSOP working group is the most appropriate WG for the draft.
*   **Digital Map Code:** Clean up code for the digital map project before making it public.
*   **Elevator Pitch for Congestion Control:** Develop a concise explanation of congestion control and its importance.
*   **Alleyon (low latency crypto) development:** Need volunteers to develop independent implementations for aleyon and benchmark with various codebases.

## Next Steps

*   **Digital Map Hackathon:** Add BGP, SIPv6. Separate three topology from ISIS topology. Add more peritola Labs. Add more vendors. And want to implement more advanced option for connecting topology to other properties in other young modules.
*   **Anomaly Detection (Antagonist):** Improve scalability and stability, and validate with real network operational data.
*   **PQ Interoperability:** Hold the next monthly meeting on August 6th.
*   **L4S Testing** - L4S interoperability event code lounge and Brighton room
*   **QUIC for Deep Space:** - sidemate meeting on Wednesday morning, 8 at Tennyson
