<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 20 Jul 2024 17:30</p>
<h1>Hackathon Kickoff</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This session served as the official kickoff for the IETF Hackathon. The presentation covered administrative details, guidelines, project information, and logistics for the weekend. Key topics included the use of Datatracker for presentation submissions, code contribution guidelines (including licensing), and available resources for hackathon participants.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Welcome and Introductions:</strong>  New attendees to the IETF and the IETF Hackathon were welcomed.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of Running Code:</strong> Emphasized the importance of implementing IETF standards and interoperability testing. The hackathon encourages developers to actively participate in the IETF process.</li>
<li><strong>Note Well:</strong>  A reminder to read and understand the IETF Note Well, covering respectful engagement and intellectual property rights. Explicit declaration of IPR is required.</li>
<li><strong>Code Contribution Guidelines and Licensing:</strong>  Participants are responsible for choosing appropriate open-source licenses for their code.</li>
<li><strong>Project Ideas and Collaboration:</strong> Participants were directed to the hackathon wiki and whiteboard for project ideas and to advertise their skills to potential teams.</li>
<li><strong>Hackathon Schedule and Logistics:</strong> Details were provided regarding the schedule for Saturday and Sunday, including lunch and dinner times, and presentation times.</li>
<li><strong>Gather Space:</strong> Gather space is available for remote teams (or hybrid teams with remote participants), participants should contact support@ietf.org for more seats.</li>
<li><strong>Presentation Guidelines:</strong> Presentations are limited to three minutes. Speakers should focus on the problem statement, solution, and potential future work, including interaction with relevant working groups.</li>
<li><strong>Presentation Submission - GitHub:</strong> For those not using datatracker, instructions were provided for uploading presentations to GitHub. Participants need to be members of the IETF Hackathon GitHub organization.</li>
<li><strong>Presentation Submission - Datatracker (Pilot):</strong> A new pilot program is being tested to integrate hackathon presentations into the IETF Datatracker. Participants are asked to upload their slides directly to the Datatracker through the agenda entry for the presentation session.</li>
<li><strong>Linking Implementations to Drafts:</strong>  Participants are encouraged to use the &quot;related implementation&quot; or &quot;related material&quot; field in Datatracker to link their code and websites to their individual drafts, helping to make the code related to the documents more discoverable.</li>
<li><strong>Hack Demo Happy Hour:</strong> There will be a Hack Demo Happy Hour on Monday where participants can present their work to the broader IETF community.</li>
<li><strong>Code Lounge:</strong> The &quot;Shared Workspace&quot; room in Brighton constable can be used for hackathon participants throughout the week. Projects can be registered to increase visibility.</li>
<li><strong>Sponsors:</strong>  Acknowledgment of the Hackathon sponsors: Ericsson, CNick, and ICAN.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Send a direct link to the Datatracker presentation upload page on the Hackathon mailing list and Zulip.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Participants should share their experience with uploading slides to Datatracker to improve the process.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Move completely to Datatracker presentation uploads only for future hackathons if the current pilot is successful.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Participants should continue working on their projects throughout the weekend.</li>
<li>Prepare presentations for the Sunday afternoon session.</li>
<li>Consider presenting at the Hack Demo Happy Hour on Monday.</li>
