<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 24 Jul 2024 22:30</p>
<h1>hrpc</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This session of the Human Rights Protocol Considerations (HRPC) research group focused on two presentations. The first presentation, by Nathan Schneider, explored the relationship between democracy and online networks, arguing for a re-thinking of protocol design with an emphasis on composable and flexible forms of governance. The second presentation, by Ali Rezaki from Nokia, discussed the challenges and gaps in designing networking technology for value outcomes related to planetary and human well-being.  Both presentations highlighted the need for increased interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Implicit Feudalism:</strong> The concept of &quot;implicit feudalism&quot; in online communities, where power is concentrated in the hands of server administrators or platform creators, and the implications for democratic participation.</li>
<li><strong>Protocol Design and Social/Political Impact:</strong>  The recognition that protocol design has significant consequences for social and political life and the need to design technologies more carefully and creatively.</li>
<li><strong>Effective vs. Affective Voice:</strong>  The distinction between &quot;effective voice&quot; (mechanisms that force powerful entities to listen) and &quot;affective voice&quot; (the ability to express opinions, even if they are ignored), highlighting the need for more mechanisms that provide effective voice in online spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Value-Based Technology Design:</strong> The challenges in translating high-level global goals (e.g., UN SDGs) into specific technology requirements and the need for collaboration across disciplines (technology, social sciences, economics).</li>
<li><strong>Metrics for Values:</strong> The difficulty in measuring qualitative aspects of values, calling for exploration of qualitative and subjective assessment techniques common in social and economic sciences.</li>
<li><strong>Limits of Technology:</strong> Recognizing the limits of technology in addressing social and environmental problems and avoiding the assumption that technology can solve every challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling Democratic Processes:</strong>  The risks of applying democratic processes to mass environments (e.g., social media) without careful consideration of how to ensure responsible stewardship and prevent manipulation or the spread of misinformation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jonathan Peterson (the note taker) will share his notes.</strong> Jonathan will also reach out to speakers and attendees to make the record more complete.</li>
<li><strong>Nathan Schneider will share his slides and his book.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eliot Lear invited Nathan Schneider to the mod discuss list to share points of view.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Alir Rezaki and Simoni from W3C will explore potential collaboration around the impact of identity technology.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Attendees are encouraged to join the MetaGov community at medigov.org.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue exploring interdisciplinary collaborations between technology experts, social scientists, economists, and other relevant stakeholders.</li>
<li>Develop more robust frameworks for translating high-level values into concrete technology requirements and for assessing the social and environmental impacts of technology.</li>
<li>Investigate mechanisms for promoting effective voice and democratic governance in online spaces.</li>
<li>Examine case studies of successful (and unsuccessful) attempts at implementing value-based technology design.</li>
<li>Further discussion on the IETF's approach to misbehavior and dysfunction in mailing lists and protocols.</li>
</ul>
