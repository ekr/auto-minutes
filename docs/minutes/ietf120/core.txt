## Summary

This CoRE working group meeting at IETF 120 covered a wide range of topics including updates on CoreConf, Concise Resource Identifiers (CRIs), conditional attributes, DNS over CoAP, transport indication, observe multicast notifications, OSCOR security, and CoAP over Bundle Protocol. Key discussions revolved around document status, review processes, addressing open issues, and planning for future interim meetings.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RFC 9423 Publication:** Announcement of RFC 9423 on the use of target attributes registry.
*   **Core Clarifications (Call Klar):** Continued effort to collect and address ambiguities and implementation challenges in existing CoRE RFCs. Focus on specific issues like request/response matching context and handling of trailing slashes.
*   **Corcom Cluster:** Progress on YANG-based configuration management protocols. Discussion around scaling issues in KOMI and aligning notification structures with other YANG-based protocols (Netconf/RESTConf).
*   **Concise Resource Identifiers (CRIs):** Status update on the HRF draft, nearing completion. Debate around deterministic behavior of CRIs.
*   **Conditional Attributes:** Update on the conditional attributes draft currently in working group last call. Discussion of handling multiple conditional attributes and their logical relationships.
*   **DNS over CoAP:** Discussion of service binding records for discovering DoC resolvers and related issues. Concern raised about the use of CBO diagnostic notation in zone files.
*   **Transport Indication:** Progress on draft, incorporating SVZ/SVCB properties, generalizing service advertisement using DNS. Debating new mechanisms and compatibilities with HTTP name resolution strategies.
*   **Observe Multicast Notifications:** Revision with CRIs for transport specific information, as well as detailed discussion on the accuracy of counting number of observers.
*   **OSCOR Capable Proxy:** Updates regarding nested OSCOR protection and escalation of CoAP option protection, as well as fixes for certain reverse-proxy scenarios
*   **OSCOR Key Update (Kudos):** Discussing the prevention of simultaneous rekeying executions and specifying steps for new ID context
*   **CoAP over Bundle Protocol:** Status of Coop-BP, including the creation of reserved domains, URI schema updates, security considerations.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Working group adoption call to be issued for `draft-lenders-core-coap-dtls-svcb`.
*   **Action Item:** Bill to produce a new revision of Conditional Attributes addressing final open issues and comments.
*   **Action Item:** Review `draft-amsus-core-transport-indication` and provide comments.
*   **Action Item:** Review Christian Amsus's review of QD Kudos

## Next Steps

*   Continue planning and scheduling interim meetings after the summer break, focusing on Core Clarifications, addressing open issues in outstanding drafts.
*   Authors to address open issues from working group last calls and shepherd reviews on various documents.
*   Continue to improve test vectors for HRF.
