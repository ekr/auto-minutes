<h1>core</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The core working group meeting at IETF 112 covered updates on several in-progress drafts, including CRI (Concise Representation of URIs), CoRAL (CBOR-based Resource Abstraction Language), CoAP Group Communication, Group OSCORE, and Key Update for OSCORE (Kudos). A new draft on a CoAP option for performance measurement was also introduced. Key discussions centered on URI data model representation, application group naming, enhanced security advice for group communication, mandatory-to-implement algorithms for Group OSCORE, and a new rekeying mechanism for OSCORE. The working group also formally adopted the &quot;Key Update for OSCORE&quot; (Kudos) draft.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working Group Status:</strong>
<ul>
<li>RFC 9100 (CoAP Sentinel Versions) was published.</li>
<li>Two documents were approved for publication as Proposed Standard and are in the RFC Editor Queue.</li>
<li>Two CoAP-CoNf documents are in ISG processing, with positive reviews.</li>
<li>Group OSCORE had its first working group last call (WGLC) comments addressed, approaching a second WGLC.</li>
<li>Chairs plan to update working group milestones. An informal meeting/interim for CoAP applications was discussed.</li>
<li>Rumors about the working group concluding were dispelled by the chairs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CRI (Concise Representation of URIs):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Aims to standardize a CBOR-based, concise URI format addressing common URI implementation errors.</li>
<li>Current version (08) defines CRI and CRI references, is CBOR-based, and is considered feature-complete for RFC 3986 subset supported by CoAP. Includes parsing for URNs and hostnames.</li>
<li><strong>Open Issues:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prefix Compression:</strong> Difficulty supporting prefix compression (e.g., JSON-LD <code>@context</code>) for partial paths due to CBOR-packed limitations. This represents a functional deficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Percent Encoding:</strong> CoAP's restrictive stance on percent encoding prevents full support for structures like W3C DIDs. A proposed solution involves alternating unencoded and percent-encoded parts within an array, though this introduces complexity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A preference was expressed for a solution within CRI over falling back to URIs, to calm the &quot;wilderness&quot; of URI usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CoRAL (CBOR-based Resource Abstraction Language):</strong>
<ul>
<li>A data model and language for describing resource metadata and interactions, optimized for constrained devices.</li>
<li>Provides semantic information via predicates, similar to RDF but more compact and constraint-device friendly (e.g., option numbers for URI predicates).</li>
<li>Users include Problem Details, PubSub, ACE group management, and potentially SDF.</li>
<li><strong>Key Updates:</strong> Information model (RDF-ish basic model + tree structure for processing), dictionary definition (leveraging packed CBOR tags, pre-populated dictionaries via media types, or named dictionaries). Text serialization has been removed in favor of EDN and Turtle examples.</li>
<li>Queries and reification are deferred to later phases.</li>
<li>Next steps include coordinating with target applications to gather a corpus for binary serialization evaluation and defining a core feature subset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Group Communication for CoAP (groupcom):</strong>
<ul>
<li>This draft serves as a normative successor to RFC 7390, covering general group communication, including CoAP Observe, Block-wise, and Group OSCORE security.</li>
<li><strong>Key Updates (v05):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removed the &quot;Multi ETag&quot; option for simplicity.</li>
<li>Clarified details on updates/obsoletions of RFCs.</li>
<li>Expanded section on &quot;Application Group Naming,&quot; allowing identifiers in URI path, query, host, port, or as a CoAP option, or implicitly.</li>
<li>Expanded section on &quot;Group Discovery,&quot; including examples of discovery via CoAP and Link Format.</li>
<li><strong>Stronger Security Advice:</strong> Explicitly states that unsecured group communication is &quot;not recommended,&quot; with exceptions like discovery requiring careful consideration and mitigation of risks (e.g., amplification attacks).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The document is deemed ready for WGLC, with additional reviews planned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Group OSCORE:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Version 13 incorporated minor updates following the first WGLC.</li>
<li><strong>Key Updates:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Terminology aligned with AD-HOC draft for public keys (referring to CCS).</li>
<li>Fixed an oversight in Group Encryption Key derivation size.</li>
<li><strong>Mandatory-to-Implement (MTI) clarified:</strong> Aligned with AD-HOC; non-constrained devices expected to support both EDDSA and ECDSA, constrained devices at least one. Similar rationale for pairwise key agreement curves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The document is considered ready for a second WGLC.</li>
<li>Test vectors are being produced, expected to be extensive, and may warrant a separate informational draft.</li>
<li>It was noted that Group OSCORE and Group Communication for CoAP should ideally proceed to WGLC in parallel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Key Update for OSCORE (Kudos):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Addresses key usage limits (encryption, failed decryptions) for AEAD algorithms, as per the C4G document.</li>
<li><strong>Part 1 (Key Limits):</strong> Defines fixed values (Q, V, L) for various algorithms, with 'L' (message size limit) now explicitly calculated in bytes. Probabilities for confidentiality and integrity advantage (CA/IA) are within safe margins, prompting an open question about increasing Q and L further.</li>
<li><strong>Part 2 (Kudos Procedure):</strong> A new one-round-trip rekeying method where client and server exchange nonces (R1, R2) to derive new contexts via <code>UpdateCtx</code>. It preserves the ID context and is compatible with AD-HOC. Extends the OSCORE option with a new flag bit and <code>id_detail</code> field.</li>
<li><strong>Observation Handling:</strong> Proposes terminating observations after rekeying due to cryptographic binding issues, as re-establishing is simpler than complex workarounds. This raised concerns about visibility at the application layer.</li>
<li>Deprecates and replaces Appendix B.2 of RFC 8613.</li>
<li>The document foundation and protocol are considered stable, with implementation plans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cacheable OSCORE:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Focused on ensuring robust request-response binding, particularly in scenarios lacking source authentication for requests (e.g., non-traditional responses, group communication with untrusted members, non-authenticated GETs).</li>
<li>The proposed solution involves embedding a hash or key information of the request into a Class I OSCORE option, making it part of the Additional Authenticated Data (AAD).</li>
<li>This approach augments the standard OSCORE binding mechanism, allowing receivers to verify responses are tied to specific requests even without source authentication.</li>
<li>This enhances cacheable OSCORE's readability and verifiability and enables new use cases where full signatures on requests are not desired.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>OSCORE Capable Proxies:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Aims to update the OSCORE RFC to define intermediaries as OSCORE endpoints, allowing for &quot;nested OSCORE&quot; (multiple layers of protection for the same message).</li>
<li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Group CoAP proxy, multicast notifications, LwM2M server as a CoAP proxy, transport indication proxies, firewalls, and potentially long proxy chains for client location privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Key Updates (v01):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lifted the previous limit of two protection layers.</li>
<li>Introduced a generalized, simplified algorithm for message processing applicable to any endpoint (client, intermediary, server).</li>
<li>Explicitly states no explicit signaling is needed; presence of CoAP options is sufficient.</li>
<li>Endpoints should not panic if an OSCORE option remains after decryption.</li>
<li>Certain options (e.g., CoAP corruption, proxy-intended options) must be protected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next steps include adding caching examples (leveraging cacheable OSCORE), elaborating on use cases for more than two layers, and exploring compression with RFC 8824.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CoAP Option for Performance Measurement:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Address the lack of simple, low-overhead performance measurement for constrained CoAP nodes, especially in unreliable modes. Existing CoAP reliability mechanisms are resource-intensive for measurement.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal:</strong> A new CoAP option carrying &quot;performance measurement bits&quot; inspired by IETF IPPM's Explicit Flow Measurement, Quick's Spin Bit, and Alternate Marking Methodology's Square Bit.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spin Bit:</strong> Creates a square wave signal whose length directly indicates RTT, reducing the need for extensive timestamping.</li>
<li><strong>Square Bit:</strong> Uses a fixed number of packets in a square wave for loss measurement.</li>
<li><strong>Event Bits:</strong> Reserved for advanced usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Easier RTT, delay, and loss measurement for constrained nodes, potential for advanced usage (e.g., adaptive protocol parameters based on network conditions).</li>
<li>Further clarification on user scenarios, especially involving proxies, is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
