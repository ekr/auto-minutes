<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 08 Nov 2021 12:00</p>
<h1>gaia</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The gaia session covered a range of topics critical to expanding internet access in underserved regions, including proposals for informal community engagement, practical challenges and policy shifts in TV White Space deployment in Tanzania, successful community network strategies in Thailand, and innovative spectrum sharing models globally. A key theme was the need for flexible regulatory frameworks that enable smaller, non-profit operators and facilitate diverse technical solutions. The session also discussed the potential revision of RFC 7944, &quot;Framework for Alternative Network Deployments,&quot; to reflect current realities and advancements.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logistics and IETF Notewell</strong>: The session started with minor delays due to login issues and a reminder of IETF Notewell policies regarding intellectual property, privacy, and respectful conduct. The working group's charter, focusing on addressing the digital divide, was briefly reiterated.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Staying in Touch&quot; Initiative (Marco Cenaro)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem</strong>: The absence of physical IETF meetings has led to a lack of informal exchange and updates within the community.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal</strong>: Organize regular (e.g., monthly/bi-monthly) informal virtual meetups or &quot;salons&quot; to foster ongoing communication.</li>
<li><strong>Format</strong>: Short (15-20 minute) technical talks on latest updates, followed by extensive Q&amp;A and experience sharing. Topics could include IoT/ML on the edge, satellite connectivity, spectrum sharing (TVWS), community networks, funding opportunities, and job postings.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: The gaia chairs will facilitate organizing initial interim meetings, possibly using a concrete challenge like Kanchana's Bangkok slum connectivity issue as a starting point. These would be lightweight meetings, open to non-IETF registered participants, leveraging the gaia mailing list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>TV White Space Deployment in Tanzania (Matagoro)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Efforts</strong>: Research started in 2014 to address high broadband costs. A Microsoft TVWS pilot in 2013 provided initial experience.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges</strong>: High bandwidth costs ($1400 USD/month for 4 Mbps plus colocation) and regulatory issues led to academic licenses expiring and devices being switched off since 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy &amp; Breakthrough</strong>: A letter from a youth beneficiary to the Prime Minister in May 2021 prompted ministerial intervention, bringing stakeholders (regulator, university, community) to the table.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Adaptation</strong>: The regulator now requires community networks to register as cooperatives, which then form limited companies, to apply for district-level licenses (approx. $300 USD fee). This commercial approach allows for financial assessment and avoids &quot;not-for-profit&quot; assessment issues.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainability Model</strong>: Matagoro proposed an 8-parameter model (<code>PPP+P</code>, including Public-Private-People Partnerships) and a 5-parameter model focusing on income-generating activities (e.g., poultry, sunflower farming) and capacity building to ensure economic empowerment and sustainability for rural communities.</li>
<li><strong>Impact on Policy</strong>: The Ministry is now considering TVWS for World Bank-funded projects, though some within the regulator remain skeptical, advocating a wait for WRC 2023 or viewing TVWS as a replacement rather than a complement to mobile broadband.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Evidence</strong>: Prior spectrum measurements, published academically, provided scientific evidence of underutilized spectrum, aiding discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Future</strong>: Developing open hardware/software for TVWS to reduce device costs and pushing for regulatory frameworks that allow proof-of-concept deployments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Community Network Experience in Thailand (Kanchana)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Regulatory Avoidance</strong>: Kanchana's strategy often involves using unlicensed Wi-Fi to avoid direct confrontation with regulators.</li>
<li><strong>TVWS</strong>: While technology was deemed okay, vendor support and equipment costs were significant hurdles, leading to TVWS being &quot;put on the shelf&quot; in Thailand.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrate First</strong>: The approach is to work around regulations, demonstrate a working solution (e.g., connecting a Bangkok slum for online learning during the pandemic), build demand, and then engage regulators when they see the tangible benefits. This has led to positive responses from government officials.</li>
<li><strong>Local Focus</strong>: Emphasized the importance of starting with local community networks that show good utilization and applications, even if not initially connected to the global internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Troubled Spectrum and Policy (Steve Song)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Inclusion Imperative</strong>: Internet growth is slowing; connecting the &quot;easy half&quot; is done. Inclusion is now the critical policy directive, as the pandemic highlighted connectivity as essential for participation.</li>
<li><strong>Spectrum Landscape</strong>: Contrasted unlicensed (Wi-Fi: low power, listen-before-talk, embedded rules) with licensed (exclusive, high cost, often locking out smaller operators).</li>
<li><strong>Challenges with Licensed Spectrum</strong>: High auction prices for mobile spectrum (e.g., $100M in Nigeria) disincentivize rural investment, limiting universal service fund impact.</li>
<li><strong>Innovative Spectrum Access Models</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>TV White Space</strong>: Formal regulation exists in Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa. Still faces hurdles with geolocation databases, higher equipment costs, and slow implementation. Needs &quot;incubatory periods&quot; (zero fees, import duty moratorium) to foster uptake.</li>
<li><strong>Shared IMT Spectrum</strong>: Emerging models in traditional mobile bands:
<ul>
<li><strong>Mexico (2016)</strong>: Set aside IMT spectrum for social purpose organizations and indigenous communities.</li>
<li><strong>USA (CBRS)</strong>: Three-tiered approach (exclusive, priority access, general access) in 3.5GHz, database-driven.</li>
<li><strong>UK (Local/Shared Access Licenses)</strong>: Pioneering &quot;use it or share it&quot; principle, allowing local access licenses for unused portions of incumbent-licensed spectrum, and dedicated shared access bands.</li>
<li><strong>Canada</strong>: Consulting on a UK-inspired shared access approach for rural areas.</li>
<li><strong>New Zealand</strong>: Long-standing &quot;managed spectrum park&quot; for local licenses (e.g., 2.5GHz band).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advocacy Role</strong>: Emphasized the importance of civil society responding to regulator consultations (Request for Comments) to influence policy, noting that these are &quot;teachable moments&quot; where regulators must consider submissions. Shared a wiki of civil society submissions for reference.</li>
<li><strong>NRENs and Fiber Backbones</strong>: Sub-Saharan Africa has underutilized fiber backbones. National Research and Education Networks (NRENs), as non-profit entities, can be key to extending access but face regulatory constraints (e.g., limited to educational institutions) and are often under-recognized as strategic national assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>RFC 7944 Revision (Leandro Navarro)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Status</strong>: The RFC, &quot;Framework for Alternative Network Deployments,&quot; was published in August 2016.</li>
<li><strong>Call for Review</strong>: Leandro queried if the document remains useful or requires updating, given significant changes in technologies, vocabulary, and understanding of successful approaches over the past few years (e.g., topics covered in this gaia session).</li>
<li><strong>Volunteer Request</strong>: Called for volunteers to contribute text, coordinate editing, and discuss specific parts needing updates or extensions.</li>
<li><strong>Matagoro's Support</strong>: Expressed strong support, highlighting the opportunity for African academia to contribute and gain experience in IETF/RFC processes, especially with the growing relevance of community networks in Africa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Informal Interim Meetings</strong>: The gaia chairs will organize informal virtual meetups between IETF sessions. Community members interested in giving talks or hosting these meetings should contact the chairs or use the gaia mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>RFC 7944 Revision</strong>: The gaia chairs will initiate a discussion on the mailing list regarding the revision of RFC 7944. Volunteers are sought to contribute to updating the document to reflect current technical, policy, and deployment realities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Community members interested in the &quot;Staying in Touch&quot; initiative should reach out to the gaia chairs (Leandro Navarro, Jane Coffin) or use the gaia mailing list to propose topics or offer to host.</li>
<li>A discussion thread will be opened on the gaia mailing list to gather input and solicit volunteers for the potential revision of RFC 7944.</li>
<li>The gaia chairs will facilitate the organization of the first informal interim meeting based on community interest and available topics.</li>
