</ul>
<h3>Project Presentations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>BMWG (Benchmarking Methodology Working Group)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: Containerized Infrastructure Performance Testing.</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Control networking performance in containerized environments.</li>
<li><strong>Accomplishments</strong>: Implemented containerized infrastructure with various network models, verified performance impacts based on configurations (SR-IOV, DPDK), tested BPP vs. OVS, and examined NUMA alignment's impact on vSwitch performance in multi-host scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Learnings</strong>: BPP generally outperformed OVS in multiple scenarios. NUMA alignment of vSwitch and NICs is critical, with different nodes showing slight degradation at higher packet sizes. Co-locating CNF and vSwitch on the same NUMA node significantly improved performance (10-50%).</li>
<li><strong>Next Steps</strong>: Further investigation into NUMA alignment results, considering multiple vSwitch cases, and discussing findings with the IETF community.</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong>: Collaborated with I2NSF and FPUA teams from SKKU.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DNS Error Reporting (EER / EITHER)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: Implementing and testing Extended DNS Error Reporting (EER).</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Inform authoritative servers about DNS resolution errors rather than just clients.</li>
<li><strong>Accomplishments</strong>: Implemented a server-agnostic solution using eBPF to send unsolicited EER options. Conducted RIPE Atlas measurements (1000 probes) to assess resolver resilience to unsolicited EDNS options.</li>
<li><strong>Learnings</strong>: 99% of resolvers handled the unsolicited EDNS option without issues, with the remaining 1% being inconclusive. The mechanism could provide DMARC-like confidence for DNSSEC deployment by offering feedback to domain operators. eBPF proved a powerful and flexible tool for augmenting existing name server installations.</li>
<li><strong>Next Steps</strong>: Large-scale measurements to confirm resilience, explore a new IETF draft on &quot;DMARC for DNS&quot; for DNSSEC confidence.</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong>: Willem Toorop, Tonko Park.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I2NSF (Interface to Network Security Functions)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: Distributed Network Auditing System using Hyperledger Fabric.</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Enhance the security and reliability of the I2NSF framework by using a distributed database for auditing.</li>
<li><strong>Accomplishments</strong>: Integrated Hyperledger Fabric as a distributed database to store monitoring data collected by the I2NSF analyzer via a monitoring interface. Developed a web server for the secure controller to display this monitoring data.</li>
<li><strong>Learnings</strong>: Distributed databases tackle data tampering (e.g., supply chain attacks) and eliminate single points of failure, improving overall framework security and reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Next Steps</strong>: Store more data (security policies, NSF capabilities) in the distributed database.</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong>: Collaborated with SKKU, BMWG, and IPWave teams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IPWave (Internet Protocol for Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: Implementation of IPWave Context Over Navigation Protocol (CNP).</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Enable communication between robot cars and web servers using CNP, incorporating W3C Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS).</li>
<li><strong>Accomplishments</strong>: Demonstrated CNP message delivery over C-V2X (Cellular V2X) in simulation (SUMO for mobility, OMNeT++ for C-V2X communication). Implemented vehicle structure and IPv6 stack for CNP in OMNeT++. Also demonstrated robot car sending sensing and speed information via Wi-Fi to a web server using VISS format.</li>
<li><strong>Learnings</strong>: Showcased the feasibility of C-V2X for vehicular communication, complementing existing WAVE (IEEE 802.11p) stacks. IPWave working group should consider both WAVE and C-V2X for future vehicular communication.</li>
<li><strong>Next Steps</strong>: Further integrate and test with different communication technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong>: Collaborated with SKKU, BMWG, and I2NSF teams.</li>

<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Create large-scale test harnesses and reference implementations for ASPA, focusing on validation cache-to-router communication.</li>
<li><strong>Accomplishments</strong>: Implemented ASPA verification in the BGP SRx software suite (supporting draft version 8 and future algorithm corrections). Extended RFC 8210 to carry ASPA objects. Generated internet-scale ASPA data using CATA reference data (Oct 2020) and Route Views BGP updates, producing data sets for various unique AS paths (e.g., 70k customer registrations, 180k link relationships). Performed preliminary ASPA validation, observing expected valid/invalid/unknown rates for provider/customer scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Learnings</strong>: Initial results confirmed the AS path validation logic (valid, invalid for route leaks, unknown for insufficient info, unverifiable for AS_SET). Demonstrated the infrastructure for large-scale testing.</li>
<li><strong>Next Steps</strong>: Run tests with multiple peers and different implementations for performance and interoperability comparison. Analyze gradual deployment scenarios to understand positive impact thresholds. Clean up and publish hackathon code on GitHub.</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong>: Oliver Gasser.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ansible API Generator (Customized)</strong></p>

<li><strong>Accomplishments</strong>: Developed <code>Ansible-Gene</code>, an automatic API generation tool that integrates into the Ansible framework. It supports customized input parameter checks and functionality. Successfully delivered L3VPN service to a device via an Ansible playbook using generated APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Learnings</strong>: Documentation is as crucial as code for adoption. Early and frequent testing helps catch and fix bugs efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Next Steps</strong>: Support the latest Ansible versions, explore more efficient ways to define enterprise profiles.</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong>: Tufan Geng, Frank, Qingbin, Wai, Xiang.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WHIP (WebRTC-HTTP Ingest Protocol)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: Interoperability tests for WHIP (WebRTC-HTTP Ingest Protocol).</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Test client-server communication using WHIP signaling (version 0.1) and underlying WebRTC exchanges with heterogeneous WebRTC stacks.</li>
<li><strong>Accomplishments</strong>: Conducted interoperability tests among 4 server implementations and 6 client implementations. Most tests were successful, identifying and resolving several issues. Earlier tests helped inform fixes in WHIP version 0.1.</li>
<li><strong>Learnings</strong>: Identified issues included assumptions about <code>Location</code> headers, <code>mid</code> usage in WebRTC (affecting Pion stack), hard-coded codec preferences (causing failed negotiations), self-signed certificate acceptance, and missing support for bearer tokens/CORS. Many issues led to fixes in client/server implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Next Steps</strong>: Test authentication (bearer tokens), proper use of <code>Location</code> and <code>Link</code> headers, automatic STUN/TURN configuration, ICE restarts and related race conditions, and session cleanup.</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong>: Lorenzo Miniero, Sergio Garcia Murillo, Tim Panton, Dan Jenkins, Cameron Elliott, Alberto Gonzalez-Stoic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine Readable Documents and Tools (Augmented Packet Header Diagrams)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: Regularizing packet header diagrams for automated parser code generation.</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Develop tooling to automatically generate protocol parser code from standardized ASCII packet header diagrams in IETF drafts.</li>
<li><strong>Accomplishments</strong>: Regularized the format of ASCII packet header diagrams and their descriptive lists in documents for parsability. Developed prototype tooling that generates Rust parser code from these diagrams. The format is adopted in the TCP BIS draft, allowing automatic TCP parser generation.</li>
<li><strong>Learnings</strong>: Discussions focused on improving the &quot;structured English phrases&quot; for human readability and identifying mechanisms to mark structured text components to prevent accidental editing during RFC publication.</li>
<li><strong>Next Steps</strong>: Add flexibility for generating parsers in more languages and improve robustness of the tooling to handle drafts that may not use the format.</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong>: Stephen MacCuspin, Mark Pettigrew.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine Readable Documents and Tools (Computer Specifying)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: Ensuring correctness of examples in RFCs through computer-aided specification.</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Generate provably correct examples and ensure consistency with normative text by embedding executable code within specification documents.</li>
<li><strong>Accomplishments</strong>: Extended <code>asciidoc</code> to embed and evaluate <code>Idris</code> code, inserting calculation results directly into the document (e.g., XML2RFC, HTML, PDF output). Developed an <code>abnf</code> library in <code>Idris</code> for defining and pretty-printing ABNF grammars. Demonstrated a method to generate a &quot;proof&quot; (type) that a string is syntactically correct according to an ABNF grammar (e.g., for S-expressions).</li>
<li><strong>Learnings</strong>: ABNF alone is insufficient to describe all PDU constraints, necessitating higher-order logic and dependently typed languages like Idris to build proofs of correctness for generated examples.</li>
<li><strong>Next Steps</strong>: Continue developing Idris libraries for common IETF draft problems. Release <code>asciidoc</code> extensions (version 15) with new features.</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong>: Mark Pettigrew, Stephen MacCuspin, Colleen, Robert, Gene, Lucas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IoT Security</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: Implementing and integrating various IoT security specifications.</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Implement specifications from IETF IoT security working groups (CoAP, DTLS, SUIT, DICE), offer tutorials, and integrate different components.</li>
<li><strong>Accomplishments</strong>: Held tutorials for new participants (slides and recordings available). Developed security extensions for TLS and mDTLS (e.g., BSAF crypto, connection IDs). Released Wireshark dissector code for some IoT protocols (already merged). Enhanced lightweight M2M client (Beckhammer) with security support. Deep dives into real-time operating systems for future integration. Identified several issues with SUIT and DICE specifications.</li>
<li><strong>Learnings</strong>: Experience with embedded development is crucial. Tutorials were useful for onboarding. Identified open issues in current specs for working group discussion. Noted &quot;online fatigue&quot; as a challenge for sustained focus.</li>
<li><strong>Next Steps</strong>: Continue implementation efforts, follow up on identified spec issues. Send hardware to participants (delayed due to bureaucracy).</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong>: Hannes Tschofenig, various newcomers and returning participants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>API Tax</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: Developing a standard API for digital payments taxation.</li>
<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Address the complexity of introducing taxes on digital payments, particularly for international transactions, by standardizing tax lookups and registration.</li>
<li><strong>Accomplishments</strong>: Reviewed existing literature and initial design specifications. Developed a prototype in Go for looking up tax rates using ISO codes, exploring Stripe API as a basis.</li>
<li><strong>Learnings</strong>: Existing solutions (e.g., Stripe API) predominantly cover North America and Europe, highlighting a gap for African and Asian countries. Considered relevant SDOs (EMVCO, PCI, OECD) and RFCs (RFC 5280) for security and transaction flows.</li>
<li><strong>Next Steps</strong>: Develop a more complete API specification with examples and direct links to tax authorities for automated payments. Detail security and privacy aspects, potentially leveraging existing RFCs. Explore implementations in other languages.</li>
<li><strong>Team</strong>: Benson Muite, Moses Ledwiko, Ali Hussein (feedback).</li>
</ul>
