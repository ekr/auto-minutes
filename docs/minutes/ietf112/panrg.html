<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 11 Nov 2021 16:00</p>
<h1>panrg</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The panrg session covered administrative updates, including a brief IAB review of the research group's activities. Key discussions revolved around the status of the <code>pan-rg-questions</code> draft, the evolution of the <code>vocabulary of path properties</code> draft, and a presentation on describing satellite networks using panrg terminology. A significant portion of the session was dedicated to an analysis of multi-path Quick (MPQUIC) against the impediments to path-aware networking deployment (RFC 9049), which sparked a broader conversation about the future of multi-path in the IETF and the role of panrg.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Administrative Updates</strong>
<ul>
<li>The IETF/IRTF Notewell was presented, emphasizing IRTF follows IETF intellectual property rules.</li>
<li>Meeting logistics (audio/video off unless speaking, headphones recommended, VPN issues, pre-loaded slides).</li>
<li>Corey was thanked for serving as minutes taker.</li>
<li>The agenda included presentations on vocabulary, satellite networks, multi-path selection, followed by 40 minutes of open mic time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>pan-rg-questions draft Status</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <code>pan-rg-questions</code> draft is awaiting its document shepherd and final feedback from Gauri and GitHub.</li>
<li>Brian Trammell committed to rolling a new draft version during the open mic session.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IAB Review of panrg</strong>
<ul>
<li>The IAB conducted a review of panrg in September/October.</li>
<li><strong>Next Steps identified for panrg:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Continue answering the research questions in the <code>pan-rg-questions</code> draft. The path properties draft is a good answer to the first question.</li>
<li>Consider research applications of Path Aware Networking (PAN) properties to IETF protocols (e.g., Spencer's multi-path work).</li>
<li>Reached out to the ALTO Research Group to invite them to panrg for related work.</li>
<li>panrg should operate as a general venue for discussions at the intersection of routing and transport.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vocabulary of Path Properties (Rees Kressin)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draft Updates:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Revised 'entity' definition to be more specific: entities play a role related to pathway networking for particular paths and flows (e.g., data plane for forwarding, control plane for influencing forwarding).</li>
<li>Formalized 'transparency' definition as a function <code>f(flow F, meta-information M) = action A</code>, where the node is transparent if <code>A</code> is constant regardless of <code>M</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion on Defining Terms:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The draft aims to define key terms used in other panrg documents (e.g., &quot;routing domain identifier&quot; from the questions draft).</li>
<li>Spencer Dawkins requested adding a pointer to the GitHub repository in the draft.</li>
<li>Discussion on the scope of definitions: how deep to go? Brian Trammell suggested stopping when existing IETF definitions can be referenced, and for core terms, a &quot;research group last call&quot; approach.</li>
<li>Sabine D'Hondt suggested context-specific definitions (e.g., &quot;endpoint&quot; in routing vs. transport). Rees clarified the document aims for general definitions within the panrg scope.</li>
<li>Gauri emphasized defining &quot;endpoint&quot; and &quot;end-to-end&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Feedback Mechanism:</strong> GitHub issues are preferred for specific definition feedback; mailing list for general scope discussions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Satellite Networks and Path Properties (Nikola):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background:</strong> Historical TCP tuning for GEO satellites, challenges with Quick over satellite, increasing GEO/LEO capacities, need for satellite-aware transport.</li>
<li><strong>Application of panrg Terminology:</strong> The authors attempted to describe generic satellite communication (satcom) systems using the <code>vocabulary of path properties</code> terms (host, node, path properties).</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Next Steps:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rees Kressin suggested mapping the satcom problem space to the panrg research questions.</li>
<li>Brian Trammell expressed interest in a deeper exploration of satcom in panrg, potentially as an &quot;architecture&quot; document illustrating how the internet adapts to this technology.</li>
<li>Gauri offered to help split the existing TSVWG document (which was very transport-centric) into two: one defining satellite systems and their properties/challenges for panrg, and another for transport fixes for TSVWG. This was positively received.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Multipath Selection Strategies (Spencer Dawkins)</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation:</strong> Multi-path is becoming ubiquitous, common, deployable, and ambitious (SCTP, MPTCP, DCCP, and now MPQUIC).</li>
<li><strong>MPQUIC Analysis Against RFC 9049 (Impediments to PAN Deployment):</strong> Spencer assessed the proposed multi-path Quick extensions against the 13 lessons learned from RFC 9049.
<ul>
<li><strong>Positive Outlook:</strong> MPQUIC performs well against most impediments, especially as extensions are endpoint-to-endpoint and encrypted, negating concerns about network operator involvement or trust of midpoints (which were major showstoppers for older PAN technologies).</li>
<li><strong>Remaining Challenges/Considerations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Justifying deployment depends on the path selection strategy (e.g., bandwidth aggregation).</li>
<li>&quot;High quality&quot; alternative paths are crucial, and &quot;quality&quot; is application-dependent (Gauri).</li>
<li>Support in endpoint stacks depends on advanced scheduling, which is currently out of scope for the initial MPQUIC draft.</li>
<li>Planning for failure requires knowing when to discard unhelpful paths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Discussion:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Med pointed out that benefits for early adopters have changed post-QUIC, with major players driving initial deployments.</li>
<li>Cyril highlighted that partial deployment benefits heavily rely on the existence of <em>different high-quality</em> alternative paths.</li>
<li>Maria agreed, pointing to the IAB workshop on measuring user experience report as relevant.</li>
<li>Tanji asked about the different strategies for multi-path (endpoint-based like MPQUIC vs. midpoint-proxy like ATSS/5G UPF). Spencer noted this is a key question for panrg.</li>
<li>Brian Trammell sees MPQUIC as an exciting &quot;actuation side&quot; testing ground for path awareness, even before full sensing mechanisms.</li>
<li>Chris pointed out the complexity of multi-path on phones (Wi-Fi + cellular), where different entities make steering decisions, potentially leading to competition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Open Mic / General Discussion</strong>
<ul>
<li>The conversation continued on multi-path, its connection to path awareness, and where various research aspects fit within the IETF (panrg, iccrg, or other groups).</li>
<li>Zohar and Colin acknowledged the overlap across groups and generally favored broad groups over hyper-specialized ones.</li>
<li>Sabine D'Hondt mentioned an ALTO WG draft under IESG review that conveys abstracted path information between endpoints, which could be relevant to panrg's discussions on path properties and application performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>pan-rg-questions Draft:</strong> Brian Trammell rolled a new version (pan-rg-questions-11) during the meeting to incorporate feedback from Gauri and GitHub.</li>
<li><strong>Vocabulary of Path Properties Draft:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rees Kressin will add a pointer to the GitHub repository in the draft.</li>
<li>Community to provide specific definition feedback via GitHub issues; general scope discussions on the mailing list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Satellite Networks Draft:</strong> Nikola and co-authors will revise the draft to focus on defining satellite systems and discussing panrg research questions, potentially splitting transport-specific content into a separate document or WG. Gauri offered direct assistance with this.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-path Discussion Follow-up:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spencer Dawkins will send links to relevant ATSS/multipath-quick interim drafts to the panrg mailing list.</li>
<li>Sabine D'Hondt will send a link to the ALTO working group draft on conveying abstracted path information to the panrg mailing list and consider presenting it at a future meeting.</li>
<li>Chairs of panrg, iccrg, and IETF ADs will discuss appropriate venues for various multi-path research questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Provide feedback on the <code>vocabulary of path properties</code> draft, particularly for core terms (entity, node, host, link, path element, path), via GitHub issues before the next meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Satellite Networks Document:</strong> Nikola and co-authors to develop the panrg-focused version of the satellite networks document, leveraging panrg terminology and addressing research questions.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-path Research:</strong> Continue to explore the implications of multi-path Quick and other multi-path technologies, particularly regarding advanced scheduling, path selection strategies, and their interaction with path awareness concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Guiding Principles:</strong> Continue to follow the IAB review recommendations: answer panrg questions, consider research applications of PAN to IETF protocols, and operate as a venue for routing and transport intersections.</li>
