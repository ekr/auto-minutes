# NTP Working Group Meeting - IETF 123

## Summary

The NTP Working Group held its first session of IETF 123 on the morning of the meeting week. The session covered document status updates, progress reports on NTPv5, NTS implementations for PTP and CSPTP, NTS pool development, and hackathon results. Key highlights included the publication of two new RFCs, ongoing work on security implementations, and experimental NTS pool deployment.

## Key Discussion Points

### Document Status Updates
- **Rough Time**: Ready for IESG submission, only waiting on shepherd write-up completion
- **NTP over PTP**: Also ready for IESG submission
- **New RFCs Published**:
  - NTP Interleave Modes (thanks to Miroslav)
  - Enterprise Profile for PTP (thanks to Doug and Hico)
- TikTok Working Group has been closed, with remaining work transferred to NTP Working Group

### IEEE 1588 Update (Hico)
- IEEE 1588 working group now operates on 5-year roll-up revision cycles
- Current roll-up revision in progress (first since 2019 standard)
- New amendments in development including security upgrade (1588a) and announce message disabling
- **Client Server PTP (CSPTP)**: New version designated as IEEE 1588.1
  - Uses NTP-like client-server approach with 1588 message formats
  - Vote ongoing to adopt contribution as working draft
  - Goal to secure CSPTP using NTS due to protocol similarities with NTP

### NTPv5 Development (Tal)
- Several sections revised with editorial changes: abstract, introduction, basic concepts, security considerations
- Differences between v5 and v4 moved to separate section
- Poll interval discussion updates reflected in document
- Requirements document comparison completed - found 5 alignment issues:
  - 3 easy fixes planned for NTPv5 spec
  - 2 open issues under mailing list discussion
- Focus shifted to completing spec rather than separate requirements document

### NTS for PTP (Martin)
- Development currently on hold pending security discussions in IEEE 1588 Security Subcommittee
- **Major shift**: NTS for PTP will likely function solely as key management system
- Security parameter application will be part of PTP standard itself
- Reviewing replay protection and other aspects
- Aiming for solution compatible with PTP, CSPTP, and other key management systems

### NTS Pools (David)
- Draft published ~6 months ago to lower NTS adoption barriers
- Experimental setup currently working, seeking more pool servers
- **Protocol changes**: Defines 5 new records for NTS key exchange (possibly 6)
- Discussion on experimental vs. standards track status - leaning toward standards track
- Ready for working group adoption consideration
- Timeline for production-ready setup in short term with 2026 funding secured

### Hackathon Results
- Work on NTS pools with additional servers added
- NTPv5 implementations (Chrony and PDRS) now support same draft version
- CSPTP experimentation with NTS integration
- Server setup was straightforward once internet reachability established

## Decisions and Action Items

- **Shepherd write-up**: Needed for Rough Time document - call for volunteers or chairs will complete
- **NTS Pools**: David to post mailing list update about document and upcoming adoption call
- **NTPv5**: Continue addressing remaining 5 requirements alignment issues
- **Interoperability testing**: Still needed for NTPv5 implementations

## Next Steps

- Virtual interim meeting planned for September timeframe
- Next physical meeting at IETF 124 in Montreal (November)
- Working group adoption call for NTS Pools document in timeframe leading to next virtual interim
- Continue mailing list discussions on open NTPv5 requirements issues
- Ongoing development of security solutions for PTP/CSPTP integration
