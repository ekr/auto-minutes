## Summary

The IETF 123 meeting of the Moderation Procedure Working Group (modpod) discussed the current status of the working group document, which the editors believe is ready for working group last call. The document has undergone several revisions since Bangkok, with zero open PRs and zero content-related issues remaining. Key discussion focused on clarification of moderator team authority in urgent situations and the intersection between moderator team actions and chair responsibilities.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Document Status**: Editors reported the document has zero open PRs and zero content-related issues, with only two tracking/tooling issues remaining

• **Recent Changes Summary**:
  - Added non-normative appendix with examples of disruptive behavior
  - Removed BCP 14 language (capital verbs) from the document
  - Clarified intersection between moderator team and chair moderation responsibilities
  - Shifted focus to discussing IETF moderation policy rather than just the moderator team
  - Applied procedures to all IETF public participation channels ("fora")

• **Moderator Team vs. Chair Authority**: Discussion on when moderators can act without waiting for chair response, particularly in urgent situations like sexual harassment

• **Reporting Requirements**: Clarification needed on what constitutes "actions that restrict posting rights" for reporting purposes to the IESG

• **Appendix Concerns**: Need for stronger language to prevent "lawyering" based on the non-normative examples list

## Decisions and Action Items

• **Working Group Last Call Decision**: Poll conducted with 90% yes votes to proceed with working group last call

• **Action Items**:
  - Ted Lemon to submit PR addressing urgent intervention scenarios (e.g., sexual harassment cases)
  - Ted Lemon to provide text strengthening the appendix language to prevent misuse of examples
  - Chris Box to propose wording clarification for "actions that restrict posting rights"

## Next Steps

• Working group last call will commence after the pending PRs from Ted Lemon and Chris Box are submitted and incorporated

• Editors will complete final editorial pass during the extended timeline to accommodate vacation schedules

• Document expected to be finalized for working group last call within 1-2 weeks following incorporation of final changes
