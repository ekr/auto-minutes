## Summary

The SCITT working group meeting covered updates on the architecture and Scrappy drafts, a hackathon report and demo, potential future work involving case extensions aligning with the Re-Scale materials use case, and a brief discussion of VCONs. Key discussions centered around the status of the architecture and Scrappy drafts, hackathon implementations demonstrating SCITT interoperability, extending SCITT to hardware and computer architecture layers, and aligning SCITT with the Re-Scale project for supply chain security.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Architecture and Scrappy Draft Status:** The architecture draft is undergoing an IESG review, and the Scrappy draft is being cleaned up and updated. Dependency of the architecture draft on the reference API was removed to expedite its publication.
*   **Hackathon Demo:** Interoperability of SCITT transparency services was demonstrated using Microsoft's Clip and DataTrails implementations, with a third-party verification by Trade Verified.  The demo involved generating receipts for the same signed statement and storing artifacts in an Azure container registry.
*   **Scrappy API Enhancements:** Proposal to enhance the Scrappy API by using a Cozy keyset format for transparency service key discovery to achieve a completely Cozy/CBOR-based API.
*   **Hardware and Computer Architecture Layer:** Discussion of extending SCITT to include hardware and computer architecture, potentially requiring a rechartering of the working group or a separate group.
*   **Re-Scale Alignment:** Presentation on the Re-Scale project, a EU project focusing on supply chain security, and how it could align with SCITT by using SCITT for trust storage and treating Re-Scale's T-bombs as statements. Cyclone DX is used for all documents, with links to external references.
*   **VCONs:** Thomas Howe presented an update on the interaction between SCITT and VCONs, including VCON consent attachment and VCON usage of SCITT ledger.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Contribute the use case for Re-Scale to the use case document.
*   **Decision:** Use a Cozy keyset format for transparency service key discovery in Scrappy.

## Next Steps

*   Complete IESG review of the architecture draft and proceed to IETF publication.
*   Continue cleanup and updates to the Scrappy draft, including the implementation of a Cozy keyset format for key discovery.
*   Further explore alignment with the Re-Scale project and incorporate their use case into SCITT.
*   Consider the implications and requirements for extending SCITT to hardware and computer architecture layers.
*   Participate in interop testing for SCITT implementations.
