# EDM Program Meeting

## Summary

The EDM Program meeting covered two main topics: the EDM protocol greasing document and a philosophical discussion on deployability of IETF work. The greasing document discussion focused on incorporating feedback, clarifying the document's scope, and preparing it for broader community review. The deployability discussion centered on the IETF's role in ensuring its work is deployable, the challenges in achieving deployment, and potential approaches for improving deployment considerations.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **EDM Protocol Greasing Document:**
    *   Dave Taylor's pull requests have significantly improved the document's readability.
    *   Need to clarify the document's scope, specifically highlighting that the recommendations apply to extensibility models where unknown values are ignored.  Quick frames were discussed as an example where greasing is applied differently.
    *   Consider including SIP and RTP experiences due to their different wire images and actors.
    *   Discussion on the IAB's adoption process and the need for community review before adoption.
    *   Concerns raised regarding security considerations, specifically around fingerprinting, TLS fingerprinters, and how greasing might affect them.
    *   Importance of identifying the applicability of protocols to avoid confusion.

*   **Deployability Discussion:**
    *   Initial assertions regarding the IETF's (and individuals within it) view on running code and deployment.
    *   The gap between "running code" and "deployed code" has widened, requiring more active consideration of deployment.
    *   Challenges in predicting the future and ensuring deployed protocols are actually used.
    *   Discussion of whether the IETF should focus on "deployable code" versus simply "running code."
    *   Impact of large vendors vs. smaller groups on protocol deployment.
    *   The distinction between specifying a protocol and its practical implementation.
    *   Importance of having a deployment plan as part of the development lifecycle.
    *   Historical context of the IETF and the changing landscape of deployment.
    *   Role of interoperability testing in ensuring deployability.
    *   The need to address the API surface of protocols to facilitate deployment.
    *   The idea of adding a deployability consideration to RFCs.
    *   The value of including a list of implementers in an RFC.
    *   Deployability is context sensitive and depends on goals.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   Lucas, Dave, and [Unclear who] will huddle to address open issues and revise the EDM protocol greasing document.
*   The greasing document will undergo broader community review after the authors' revisions.

## Next Steps

*   The EDM Program will continue working on the greasing document.
*   Consider meeting again at the next IETF meeting in Montreal.
