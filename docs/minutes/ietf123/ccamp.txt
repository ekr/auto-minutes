## Summary
The CCAMP session covered a variety of topics related to GMPLS and optical networking. Presentations included updates on WDM interface parameters, WDM tunnels, coherent pluggables, and data models for optical transport networks. Discussions focused on dependencies between drafts, open issues, and potential new work items. Working group adoption was requested for some documents.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Dependencies:**  Several documents are dependent on the finalization of drafts in other working groups, especially TITH. The status of 1923b and the T-tunnel document were highlighted as critical paths.
*   **WDM Tunnel Modeling:**  Significant discussion around modeling WDM tunnels with regenerators. Clarification needed on the definition of incoming and outgoing transponders in regenerator scenarios.
*   **Pluggable Gap Analysis and Modeling:** The work to provide gap analysis for the optical plugables. The aim is the use cases that Oscar mentioned, it has to be able to support that..
*   **Coherent Pluggables:** Use cases and network scenarios for packet optical integration with coherent pluggables were discussed. Debate around manifest use, external database, and the level of normalization for physical impairments.
*   **FGOTN Data Model:** A data model for fine-grained optical transport networks was presented, focusing on the control interface and F-G Heightly's Resizing.
*   **Microwave Radio Links:**  Ongoing work to update the microwave radio link draft (revision of 8561) was presented including discussion around issues related to cross-polarization, maintenance timers, and receiver diversity.
*   **CMAP applicability on OTN/WDM networks:** Presentation on a new draft discussing the benefits of CMAP in OTN/WDM networks. Open discussion on the right working group (CCAMP or NMOP).
*   **PM Streaming:** Presentation on a young data model of performance management measurement that is structured with hierarchical and measurement time interval.
*  **Onions Discussion:** The working group's attention to onions discussion that will take the service and abstraction and coordinate it. SeaCamp is being called out as the working group that might have some aspects.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **WDM Interface Parameter YANG:**  Authors will request a new YANG doctor review and an area director review.
*   **WDM Tunnel YANG:** Authors need to add some text describe in detail of those regenerated scenarios and how they can the model design to a common all those scenarios and validate the young model against all the reference scenarios.
*   **Pluggable Gap Analysis and Modeling:** Wait for version 03 before starting the working group adoption process.
*   **Microwave Radio Links:**  Update the draft name to include "draft-ietf-ccamp-radio".
*  **CMAP applicability on OTN/WDM networks:** To take into account no matter where we go we better keep the two working groups aligned about these evolutions to make sure that the other working group is happy with what we do and then the next step is continue the work, update the missing sections and so on

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address open issues and feedback on presented drafts.
*   Continue weekly meetings for ongoing draft development.
*   Monitor the progress of dependent drafts in other working groups (TITH).
*   Consider the implications of the Onions discussion on future CCAMP work.
