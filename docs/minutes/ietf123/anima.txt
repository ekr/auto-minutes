## Summary

This meeting covered the status of various ANIMA documents, including RFC 8366bis, Constrained Brewski and Joint Proxy, Brewski Cloud, and Discovery documents. Discussions revolved around dependencies, security considerations, working group last calls, and implementation efforts. New documents on registrar and masa considerations were also discussed, and potential use cases for combining Brewski and GRASP without an ACP were explored. The group also reviewed the presentations from the interim meeting and discussed how those ideas could be standardized within the ANIMA framework, focusing on Autonomic Service Agents (ASAs).

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RFC 8366bis Dependency:** The group discussed the dependency of several drafts on RFC 8366bis and decided to keep these drafts in their current state to facilitate easier editing.
*   **Brewski PRM TLS Usage:** Clarifications were made regarding TLS usage in Brewski PRM, emphasizing TLS 1.3 but acknowledging TLS 1.2.
*   **Constraint Brewski and Joint Proxy:** Discussions centered on the completion status of these drafts, the need for a second working group last call, and addressing previous review comments. The use of COAP vs. JPY was debated and a decision was made to use the JPY scheme.
*   **Brewski Discovery:** The scope and structure of the Brewski Discovery document were discussed, specifically regarding the IANA registries and transparent proxy behavior.  Clarification of "CMS" to explicitly mean CMS with JSON encoding.
*   **8366 bis Issues:** Problems with SID allocations for the YANG model using existing tooling.
*   **Constraint GRASP:** The application scenarios of C-Grasp, its relationship to COAP, and the need for multicast relay mechanisms were discussed.
*   **Registrar and MASA Considerations:** Potential merger of these documents and discussion of title choices. Operational vs Implementation considerations were heavily discussed.
*   **Automation Network Infrastructure:** The presentation on combining Brewski and Grasp without an ACP was discussed and well-received.
*   **Autonomic Service Agents (ASAs):** The group discussed standardizing elements of ASAs and integrating them with the ANIMA architecture.
*   **New Use Cases Discussion:** Discussion on how to promote more follow-up and collaboration from the new use cases that came out of the last interm meeting.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **RFC 8366bis PRM:** Keep PRM on hold until RFC 8366bis progresses.
*   **Constraint Brewski & Joint Proxy:** Authors to address IP disclosures and POC implementations questions and report to the mailing list. Restart the working group last call once reviews have been addressed. Authors to email individual reviewers. Shepard check by chair needed prior.
*   **Constraint Joint Proxy:** Change scheme to JPY.
*   **Brewski Discovery:** Obtain expert reviews, continue refining DNS-SD aspects, and aim for a working group last call at IETF 120.
*   **8366 bis:** Look for new shepherd.
*   **GRASP distribution:** Park the document for one year.
*   **Automation Network Infrastructure:** Chair to ask for adoption at IETF 124.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address feedback and prepare updated drafts for upcoming IETF meetings.
*   Continue discussion on the anima mailing list.
*   Follow up with proponents of new use cases to help them move their proposals forward.
*   Explore prototyping and experimentation efforts with ASAs, including developing software packages.
