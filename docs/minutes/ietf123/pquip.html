<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 22 Jul 2025 09:30</p>
<h1>pquip</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The pquip meeting covered the status of existing documents, updates from the Hackathon, discussions on stateful hash-based signatures, adapting constrained devices for PQC, hybrid signature spectrums, a potential new working group item summarizing PQC algorithms, and a discussion about composite key formats. Several action items were identified, and future discussion topics were highlighted.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hybrid Signature RFC:</strong>  The RFC on hybrid signature spectrums is nearing completion, awaiting review from an AD who has been busy.</li>
<li><strong>PQC Hackathon:</strong>  The hackathon included interoperability testing of PQC algorithms, focusing on composite keys and updates to the OID list.  Participants tested various implementations and added new artifacts to the GitHub repository. Seed format support in crypto libraries was discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Stateful Hash-Based Signatures:</strong> Discussion focused on the state management document's readiness for working group last call. There were differing opinions on whether to emphasize the difficulty of state management or focus on best practices. Overlap with an existing ETSI document was raised as a concern. The need for more review and comments on the mailing list was emphasized. NIST's potential updates to SP 800-208 was also discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Adapting Constrained Devices for PQC:</strong> The presentation covered integrating PQC into constrained devices, highlighting trade-offs between memory usage, speed, and key management. Issues of MLDSA's memory footprint on small devices was discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Signature Spectrums:</strong> Clarifications were made to the document during the AD review process, including discussions on artifacts, configuration, and security definitions.</li>
<li><strong>Summary of PQC Algorithms:</strong> A new individual draft summarizing a range of widely studied post-quantum algorithms was presented. The draft aims to provide a high-level overview of various PQC algorithms, including security assumptions and standardization status, in a unified and easily comparable format. Scope and how to make the document a living document vs. an RFC were debated.</li>
<li><strong>Composite Key Formats:</strong> A discussion on composite key formats focused on whether a hybrid key should be treated as an atomic algorithm or a decomposable structure at the protocol layer. There were arguments for and against both approaches. The encoding of private keys in relation to public keys was also discussed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stateful Hash-Based Signatures:</strong>
<ul>
<li>ACTION: Authors to initiate discussion on the mailing list regarding readiness for working group last call.</li>
<li>ACTION: Authors to review overlap with existing ETSI document.</li>
<li>ACTION: Authors to monitor NIST's progress on SP 800-208 and adjust the document accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Adapting Constrained Devices for PQC:</strong>
<ul>
<li>ACTION: Authors to drive discussion on the mailing list regarding specific sections of the document needing more input and updates.</li>
<li>ACTION: Authors to add a discussion on side channel security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Summary of PQC Algorithms:</strong>
<ul>
<li>ACTION: Community to discuss and provide feedback on the mailing list regarding the criteria for algorithm selection and the overall scope of the document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussion on the mailing list for various drafts</li>
<li>Await IESG review of the hybrid signature spectrums draft.</li>
<li>Attend LAMPS meeting to discuss composite key formats.</li>
</ul>
