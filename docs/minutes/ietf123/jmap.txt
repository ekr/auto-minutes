# JMAP Working Group Meeting

## Summary

The JMAP Working Group held a joint session with CalExt covering multiple ongoing drafts and extensions. Key topics included updates on JS Calendar and JS Contact specifications, file storage extensions, email delivery push notifications, and discussions on new work for generic metadata storage. Several documents are progressing through working group last call, with JS Calendar BIS requiring updates to align with recent changes.

## Key Discussion Points

### CalExt Working Group Updates

- **JS Contact Profiles and UID drafts**: Both documents are in working group last call, scheduled to finish within the week
  - JS Contact Profiles creates a registry for defining supported elements in different protocols
  - JS Contact UID makes the originally mandatory UID property optional for better V-Card compatibility
- **JS Calendar BIS**: Reduced scope document that obsoletes RFC 8984, focusing on elements compatible with iCalendar
  - Removes semantic differences between JS Calendar and iCalendar elements
  - Introduces only two new iCalendar elements: coordinates URI property (replacing deprecated geo property) and show-without-time property
  - Enables bidirectional conversion between iCalendar and JS Calendar with minimal edge cases

### JMAP Working Group Updates

- **JMAP for Calendars**: Document was pulled back from IESG review due to dependency on JS Calendar BIS changes
  - Updated to reference new JS Calendar BIS and removed deprecated properties
  - Ready for targeted working group last call once JS Calendar BIS is approved
- **File Storage Extension**: Presentation of design considerations including access control, directory structures, change tracking, and blob diffs
  - Open questions on POSIX-style permissions, symbolic links, and change tracking semantics
  - Plans for implementation experience with server and client FUSE implementation
- **Email Delivery Push Notifications**: Adopted by working group, enables filtered push notifications with specific properties for mobile platform compatibility

### New Work Discussion

- **Generic Metadata Storage**: Proposal for JMAP extension allowing clients to store arbitrary metadata on JMAP objects
  - Similar to WebDAV dead properties functionality
  - Concerns raised about namespace collisions and client compatibility
  - Suggested approach using namespaced keys with IANA registry
- **Server Settings Extension**: Proposal for standardized way to configure server settings like timezone, language, encryption keys
  - Would complement existing vacation response functionality
  - Important for data portability when switching providers

## Decisions and Action Items

- **JS Calendar BIS**: Proceed to IESG submission after working group last call completion
- **JMAP for Calendars**: Conduct targeted working group last call focusing on JS Calendar BIS alignment changes
- **Document Shepherds**: Daniel Quiñones assigned as shepherd for JS Calendar BIS
- **New Drafts**: 
  - Maro and Hans-Jörg to write JMAP server settings draft
  - File storage extension to proceed with implementation experience
  - Metadata extension to be drafted after calendar work completion

## Next Steps

- Complete working group last call for JS Contact documents by end of week
- Submit JS Calendar BIS to IESG following successful last call
- Conduct targeted working group last call for JMAP for Calendars
- Begin implementation work on file storage and push notification extensions
- Draft proposals for metadata storage and server settings extensions
- Update working group milestones to reflect current priorities and timeline adjustments
