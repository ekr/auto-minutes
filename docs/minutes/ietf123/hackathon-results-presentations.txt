# Hackathon Results Presentations

## Summary

The IETF Hackathon Results Presentations session featured over 40 project presentations covering a wide range of networking technologies and protocols. The session began with a memorial presentation for Dave Täht, followed by technical presentations spanning topics including network modeling, authentication protocols, routing technologies, post-quantum cryptography, DNS security, network monitoring, and various IETF draft implementations. The presentations demonstrated significant interoperability testing, protocol implementations, and research contributions across multiple working groups.

## Key Discussion Points

### Memorial Presentation
- **Dave Täht Memorial**: Frank presented a tribute to Dave Täht who passed away in April, highlighting his contributions to FQ-CoDel (RFC 8290), CAKE algorithm, IPv6 work, and his fight for router firmware freedom with the FCC
- An informal wake was planned for Monday at 7 PM in El Escorial Room

### Major Technical Areas Covered

#### Network Modeling and Management
- **SIMAP**: Demonstrated topology modeling with external references and SRv6 extensions, achieving consensus on templates for operational state queries
- **Yang Provisioning**: Presented updates on Yang Provenance Signature draft with Kafka integration and microservices verification
- **Mouseworld**: Showcased network digital twins framework using Knowledge Graphs for creating twin networks in containerized environments

#### Authentication and Security
- **Agent Protocol Security**: Developed identity and authorization systems for MCP protocol using W3C DID standards
- **EDHOC KEM-based Authentication**: Implemented new authentication method for EDHOC using ML-KEM 512
- **Python Scrapers Authentication**: Integrated authentication layers with popular web scraping tools

#### Post-Quantum Cryptography
- **Logger Danan**: Successfully integrated PQC support (X25519 + ML-KEM-768 hybrid) across multiple CNCF projects
- **PQC in X.509**: Continued three-year project with 50+ participants, focusing on composite signatures and key formats
- **PQ DNSSEC**: Updated multiple implementations including BIND and CoreDNS with ML-KEM support

#### Routing and Network Protocols
- **ILNP**: Demonstrated improved IPv6 addressing flexibility with successful domestic link testing showing 50% energy savings
- **SRv6**: Multiple projects showcased SRv6 implementations including service function chaining and policy-driven routing
- **DETNET**: Presented intelligent configurator with REST API for on-the-fly deterministic network configuration

#### Monitoring and Telemetry
- **Benchmarking Network Components**: Applied CATS framework for joint compute-network capabilities exposure
- **Yang Push Validation**: Successfully validated Yang Push across entire chain from router to Kafka consumers
- **Table Snoop**: Implemented SRv6 support for Linux routing table lookup tracing tool

#### Emerging Technologies
- **SCONE**: First hackathon for new working group, achieved successful client-server interoperability for adaptive bitrate applications
- **Interface to Network Computing**: Enhanced autonomous vehicle control through natural language intent commands
- **Thread Protocol**: Demonstrated 50% energy savings through intelligent Wi-Fi interface management

#### Interoperability Testing
- **Multiple Projects**: Extensive interoperability testing conducted across various protocols including EDHOC PSK, NTP pools, and CBOR implementations
- **Cross-platform Support**: Many projects demonstrated multi-platform compatibility and vendor interoperability

## Decisions and Action Items

- **SIMAP**: Moving to modeling phase, feedback requested from community on SRv6 models
- **Yang Push**: Planning to address identified tooling issues and extend schema registry support
- **SCONE**: Protocol specification clarifications to be addressed through GitHub issues
- **PQC Projects**: Multiple implementations moving toward production readiness with vendor support
- **COSERV**: Draft to be presented to RATS working group for adoption consideration

## Next Steps

- **Hack Demo Happy Hour**: Scheduled for Monday 7-8 PM for broader IETF community demonstrations
- **Working Group Presentations**: Multiple projects scheduled to present findings in respective working group sessions throughout the week
- **Site Meetings**: Various projects organizing side meetings during IETF week for continued collaboration
- **Draft Submissions**: Several projects planning to submit or update Internet-Drafts based on hackathon results
- **Continued Development**: Many projects established ongoing collaboration plans and next hackathon objectives

The session demonstrated strong collaboration between academia, industry, and standards organizations, with significant progress made on emerging technologies and protocol implementations that will contribute to future IETF standards development.
