# Dispatch Session

## Summary

The dispatch session reviewed seven proposals for potential standardization work in the IETF. The session's purpose is to help determine appropriate venues for new work, whether through existing working groups, new working groups, area director sponsorship, or other paths. Presentations covered topics ranging from cloud storage federation to cryptographic protocols and email security.

## Key Discussion Points

### Open Cloud Mesh
- Protocol for federation of cloud storage sites to enable cross-platform data sharing
- Currently used by millions of users across research institutions and government organizations
- Built on top of WebDAV and HTTP with OAuth-like features
- **Decision**: Proceed with working group forming BOF due to demonstrated adoption and vendor interest

### RFC 4130 (AS2) Specification Update
- Current AS2 RFC uses deprecated algorithms (3DES, SHA-1) and lacks modern security features
- Industry demand for updates to include TLS 1.2+, new headers, and current best practices
- Strong vendor support from Amazon AWS, IBM, Oracle, and others
- **Decision**: Charter new working group in ART area to update specification

### JSON Challenger (CBOR Core)
- Proposal to create simplified CBOR profile for mainstream computing platforms
- Aims to reduce complexity while maintaining compatibility with CBOR RFC
- Conflict with existing CBOR working group scope and priorities
- **Decision**: Continue discussions with CBOR working group chairs about potential rechartering after current work completes

### Agent Protocol
- Discovery and addressing protocol for AI agents using agent:// URI scheme
- Early stage work with multiple competing protocols in development
- Technical concerns raised about URI constructs and ecosystem assumptions
- **Decision**: Continue with side meetings and consider non-working group forming BOF at next IETF

### JS Contact/URL Extensions
- Making contact information exchange easier with cryptographic credentials
- Two-part proposal: JS Contact extensions and encrypted authenticated resource locator (EARL)
- **Decision**: Send JS Contact extensions to CalExt working group; EARL components to JOSE or consider BOF

### Unobtrusive End-to-End Email Signatures
- New email signature format invisible to legacy mail clients
- Addresses disincentives for sending signed email messages
- Builds on recent end-to-end mail protection work from LAMPS
- **Decision**: Send to MailMaint working group with potential coordination with DKIM work

### Merkle Tree Certificates
- Integrates transparency into PKI issuance process to address post-quantum signature size issues
- Represents fundamental PKI architecture change with significant scope
- Strong technical interest but requires careful scoping
- **Decision**: Proceed with BOF with narrow, focused charter

### Private Set Intersection (PSI) based on ECDH
- Protocol for finding common data elements while preserving privacy
- Deployed by several major companies including Alipay, ByteDance
- Discussion about splitting cryptographic core from protocol implementation
- **Decision**: Requires offline discussion to clarify direction; potential CFRG involvement for crypto components

## Decisions and Action Items

- **Open Cloud Mesh**: Schedule working group forming BOF
- **AS2 Update**: Charter new working group in ART area
- **CBOR Core**: Continue discussions with CBOR WG chairs about future rechartering
- **Agent Protocol**: Continue side meetings, consider non-WG-forming BOF at IETF 124
- **JS Contact**: Split proposal - CalExt for contact extensions, JOSE/BOF for EARL
- **Email Signatures**: Send to MailMaint with coordination on DKIM overlap
- **Merkle Tree Certs**: Prepare for BOF with focused charter and mailing list
- **PSI Protocol**: Offline discussion needed to determine path forward

## Next Steps

- Working group forming BOFs to be scheduled for appropriate proposals
- Authors to engage with identified working groups for accepted proposals  
- Continued community building and technical refinement for early-stage proposals
- Follow-up discussions with area directors and working group chairs as needed
