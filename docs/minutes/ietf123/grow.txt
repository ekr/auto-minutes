## Summary

The Global Routing Operations (grow) working group meeting at IETF 121 in Madrid covered a wide range of topics, including leadership changes, IPR disclosures, and several draft updates.  Key discussions centered on automating peering, securing BGP operations, optimizing BMP convergence, and defining new data models and TLVs for BGP monitoring. A decision was made regarding the handling of the BGP Opsack document, and a vote was taken on merging the E-bit draft into the TLV draft.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Leadership Change:** Paolo Lomas joins as a co-chair, alongside current chair.
*   **Late IPR Disclosures:** Emphasized the importance of early IPR disclosures to avoid delays and workload increase for the chairs.
*   **Peering API Automation (draft-ietf-grow-peering-api-00):**
    *   Discussion on authentication methods, particularly the use of RPKI and OAuth.
    *   Feedback requested on the API discovery mechanism (currently manual).
*   **BGP Operational Security (draft-ietf-grow-bgp-opsack-update):**
    *   Limited readership was noted; discussion on how to increase awareness and review.
    *   Suggestions to seek review from an IETF directorate.
*   **BGP Terms (draft-ietf-grow-terms):** Discussion on structuring the glossary (alphabetical vs. topical).
*   **BMP Optimizations (various drafts by Prasad et al.):**
    *   Concerns raised about complexity and churn when implementing features.
    *   Discussion on splitting the aggregated Rotman message draft into two.
    *   Presentation of a new generic event notification message type (GEN).
*   **BMP YANG Model (draft-ietf-grow-bmp-yang):** Discussion on simplifying the model for easier implementation.  Concerns around dependencies on other IETF models.
*   **Path Status TLV (draft-cardona-grow-bmp-path-status):** Detailed presentation of use cases. Concerns raised regarding potential churn.
*   **BGP Communities YANG Model (draft-ietf-grow-bgp-communities-yang):** Discussion on alignment with existing BGP YANG models and augmentation possibilities.
*   **BMP Offline (draft-jcard-grow-bmp-offline):**  Discussion on route refresh alternatives and focus shift towards the station/collector side. Plans to revive `draft-petrie-grow-mrt-bmp`.
*   **BMP v4 TLV (draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv):**  Updates on stateless parsing and the mandatory timestamp. Decision to merge or not to merge the e-bit draft into the tlv draft.
*   **RPKI Monitoring Requirements:** Presented the need to monitor RPKI-related processes using BMP, covering data download, policy configuration, route validation and route actions and suggestions to extend the current BMP messages
*   **New BMP TLVs (draft-francois-grow-new-tlvs):** Presentation of three proposed TLVs: timestamp, extended flags, and sequence number. Raised concerns about memory usage and the use of flags to differentiate views from the exporter.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **BGP Opsack Update:** The chair will produce a Shepard write-up. Following Shepard write-up it will progress to Working Group Last Call. Request review from an IETF directorate after the Shepherd write-up
*   **E-bit draft:** A vote was held, and while sentiment leaned toward separate drafts, the offer was made to test a merge to evaluate readability, and make final decision based on this. Author to test merge of the drafts.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to update drafts based on the feedback received during the meeting.
*   The grow chairs will coordinate IETF directorate review of selected documents.
*   The authors of draft-petrie-grow-mrt-bmp will revive this draft
*   The authors will evaluate to merge the EBIT to the TLV BMP v4 drafts.
