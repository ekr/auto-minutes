## Summary

This meeting covered several research topics in quantum internetworking, including network evaluation, simulation tools, quantum transduction, quantum key distribution (QKD) emulation, and quantum position verification. Speakers presented ongoing work, architectures, and challenges in these areas.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Network Evaluation for Quantum Networks (Amar):**
    *   Reviewed taxonomy for routing entanglement (proactive vs. reactive, distributed vs. centralized).
    *   Discussed network abstractions and the need for convergence in network functions and services.
    *   Emphasized the need for direct comparison of networking paradigms.
    *   Highlighted the development of a prototype tool for quantum networks evaluation and paradigm comparison, focused on realism and avoiding non-physical components.
*   **Quantum Network Simulation Module for ns3 (Mohit):**
    *   Presented a quantum network simulation module built on NS3.
    *   Highlighted the use of Quantum Helper and Quantum Manager classes.
    *   Addressed the integration of classical and quantum networks.
    *   Discussed noise modeling and its integration with various components.
    *   Mentioned the availability of the module on the NS3 App Store.
*   **Quantum Transduction in the Design of Quantum Networks (Angela):**
    *   Discussed the role of quantum transduction in heterogeneous quantum networks.
    *   Presented the challenges associated with different qubit platforms and the need for quantum transduction.
    *   Explored different transduction functionalities: direct qubit transduction, hybrid entanglement generation.
    *   Explained the relationship between transduction efficiency and cooperativity.
*   **QKD Network Emulation with Kudito (Blanca):**
    *   Introduced Kudito, an open-source platform to emulate QKD network deployments.
    *   Explained the design focusing on user-friendliness and modularity.
    *   Discussed the exploration of both theoretical and networking aspects.
    *   Mentioned the plan to extend Kudito to emulate general entanglement networks.
    *   Addressed challenges in emulating quantum internet, like heterogeneity, no standards, and decoherence.
*   **Quantum Position Verification (Zian):**
    *   Brought up the topic about the Quantum Position Verification, which is a visible and exciting application in quantum networks.
    *   Discussed classical position verification and its limitations.
    *   Introduced the QPV protocol and its practical constraints, including photon loss, quantum operation error, and clock synchronization.
    *   Proposed a verifiable vertex selection algorithm and malicious prover location identification algorithm.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   The slides will be available online.
*   Follow-up discussions on specific topics will be done on the mailing list and in person at the Montreal meeting.
*   Mahasad was asked to submit their question online for the speaker on NS3 simulator.

## Next Steps

*   Continue development and testing of simulation tools and frameworks.
*   Explore emerging standards and protocols for quantum internetworking.
*   Share results and experiences on the mailing list and at future meetings.
*   Follow up the conversation with Diego and Angela about possible future work in person at the Montreal meeting.
