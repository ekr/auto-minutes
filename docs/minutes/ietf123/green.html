<h1>Green Working Group Session</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Green Working Group held its first session focusing on three draft documents for potential adoption and related work presentations. The session covered liaison statements from other standards organizations, draft presentations on use cases, terminology, and framework documents, along with two presentations on energy-aware routing work from other working groups. The chairs emphasized the importance of mailing list participation to support adoption decisions and outlined plans for interim meetings and hackathon discussions in the following session.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Energy Efficiency Routing</h4>
<ul>

<li>Focuses on IGP and BGP protocol extensions for energy data collection</li>
<li>Proposes three-step process: indicator definition, data collection, path calculation</li>
<li>Work primarily targeted at LSR, IDR, and Spring working groups</li>

</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<h3>Adoption Decisions</h3>
<ul>

<li><strong>Use cases document</strong>: Second adoption poll to be conducted on mailing list after meeting</li>
<li><strong>Framework document</strong>: Not ready for adoption but recognized as potential future candidate</li>
</ul>
<h3>Action Items</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chairs to conduct mailing list adoption polls for terminology and use cases documents</li>
<li>Participants encouraged to respond to mailing list polls to demonstrate support</li>
<li>Framework document links to be shared in chat for review</li>
<li>Chair to potentially share liaison response summaries on mailing list</li>
<li>Energy-aware QoS work to be discussed with area directors for potential IETF progression path</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terminology document</strong>: Mailing list confirmation of adoption decision</li>
<li><strong>Use cases document</strong>: Second adoption cycle with mailing list poll</li>
<li><strong>Framework document</strong>: Encourage community review and feedback, discuss open issues in tomorrow's session</li>
<li><strong>Interim meetings</strong>: Plans for additional informal interim meetings going forward</li>
<li><strong>Tomorrow's session</strong>: Focus on hackathon recap, new draft proposals, and detailed discussion of modeling work and framework open issues</li>
<li><strong>Related work coordination</strong>: Continue liaison activities with other SDOs and working groups</li>
</ul>
<p>The session emphasized the importance of mailing list participation to ensure adoption decisions reflect genuine community support beyond in-room polls.</p>

## Summary

This session focused on data models for energy efficiency and sustainability in networking. Presentations were given on drafts related to utilization scores in ISAAC, energy consumption per path (PETRA), and transport network use cases. A hackathon update highlighted practical implementations and data collection. The session also discussed next steps for developing a base data model, including a lightweight design team approach. Open modeling questions were addressed, and consensus was sought on key areas such as granularity of power control, accuracy of information, and time intervals for reporting data.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **ISAAC Utilization Scores:**  Discussion on how the ISAAC model fits into the broader working group charter and how it can be extended from a base Yang model.
*   **PETRA API:** Proposal to place PETRA as another API from the controller to get information per path. Questioned whether this should be a general query API or specifically for on-radio networks, and how it fits within the scope of green.
*   **Transport Network Use Cases:** Presentation on transport-specific barriers and proposed use cases for network-level optimization with multilayer energy-saving management.
*   **Hackathon Update:** Report on collecting metrics from different devices (routers, smart PDUs) and integrating them using the framework document. Used a video streaming use case for end-to-end consumption reporting.
*   **Design Team Formation:** Discussed the formation of a lightweight design team to focus on base data model development through regular interim meetings.
*   **Modeling Granularity:** Discussed granularity for control and reporting of power use, also addressing power states (E-Work states, ranges, framework document power states).
*   **Reporting Accuracy:** How to report the accuracy of energy usage metrics. Do we need to indicate dynamically the level of accuracy for reporting information?
*   **Reporting Time Intervals:** What time intervals should the data be reported over? Does this have to be in stone or up to the device to determine?
*   **Network vs. Device Level:** Need to design the Yang models for both network level and device levels for energy reporting.
*   **Customer Use Cases:** Discussion of what's covered and what is the aim to report to customer as end users

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Lightweight Design Team:** Agreed to proceed with a lightweight design team consisting of regular interim meetings chaired by Rob or Diego.
*   **GitHub Repository:** Set up a GitHub repository for collaborative model development, issue tracking, and discussion.
*   **Adopt Existing Documents:** Pursue adoption calls for the use cases and terminology drafts.
*   **Liaison:** Leveraging existing Liaison statements
*   **Base Model Iteration:** Jan will start writing a base model draft for discussion within the design team and broader working group.
*   **Continue Modeling Discussions:** Continue discussions on open modeling questions, particularly related to granularity, accuracy, and time intervals. Send conclusions to the list
*   **Offline Customer Discussion:** Discuss the customer-facing aspects of reporting and guidance offline

## Next Steps

*   Poll working group for scheduling the lightweight design team interim meetings.
*   Establish the GitHub repository.
*   Review and leverage relevant liaison statements.
*   Begin adoption calls for use cases and terminology drafts.
*   Commence development of the base data model draft in Yang.
*   Share detail about the separation on device and network levels of reporting, as well as what the requirements are with those to the list.
