## Summary

The mediaman working group session focused on reviewing open issues for the media type registration procedures document (update to RFC 6838). The group worked through multiple GitHub issues, making decisions on which could be closed and which required further work before working group last call. Key discussions centered on registry table modifications, change control procedures, and coordination requirements for structured suffix registrations.

## Key Discussion Points

- **Document Status**: The working group has published two chartered documents (haptics and top-level media types) and is focusing on completing the RFC 6838bis update as the remaining active draft.

- **GitHub Issues Review**: The group systematically reviewed open issues, categorizing them as ready to close, requiring text changes, or needing further discussion.

- **Registry Table Modifications**: Magnus requested adding RTP payload format indicators to the IANA registry table. Strong pushback was received due to concerns about application-specific columns making the registry unmanageable. The proposal was rejected in favor of using existing template fields.

- **Change Control Procedures**: Discussed and refined procedures for handling unresponsive change controllers, settling on a four-week waiting period before escalating to the IESG.

- **Structured Suffix Coordination**: Debated requirements for coordination with base media type and structured suffix change controllers. Agreed to soften mandatory language to avoid tying designated expert hands.

- **Community Format Ownership**: Extended discussion on who should be listed as owner for community format registrations, with rough consensus favoring IESG as default with designated expert discretion.

- **Appeals Procedures**: Decided to leave existing appeals text unchanged and refer the broader issue of designated expert appeals to IANA Services.

## Decisions and Action Items

### Decisions Made:
- **Issue #7**: Close with no action (grandfathering text adequate)
- **Issue #10**: Close with no action, refer DE appeals procedures to IANA Services  
- **Issue #13**: Keep open to acknowledge process participants
- **Issue #15**: Close with no action (existing change control recovery procedures sufficient)
- **Issue #19**: Add informational reference to RFC 6381 bucket format parameters
- **Issue #20**: Refer coordination guidance for other standards organizations to post-publication liaison activities
- **Issue #21**: Add text specifying procedures for unresponsive change controllers (4-week minimum period)
- **Issue #23**: Community format ownership defaults to IESG with designated expert discretion

### Action Items:
- Create new issue to replace "grandfathering" terminology due to problematic historical connotations
- Coordinate with IANA Services on multiple referred issues (appeals procedures, early allocation for other STOs)
- Update pull request #41 to soften structured suffix coordination language
- Add reference to RFC 7120 for early allocation procedures
- Restore mention of IESG approval option for standards tree registrations from other streams

## Next Steps

- Editorial pass to incorporate approved changes and address remaining "nit" issues
- Working group last call anticipated, with recommendation for extended duration due to substantial changes
- Possible interim meeting before next IETF to complete remaining issues
- Post-publication liaison activities with other standards organizations regarding registration procedures
- Document unlikely to reach IESG before next IETF meeting

The working group made significant progress on resolving blocking issues, with most major technical decisions completed. The focus now shifts to editorial cleanup and final review preparation.
