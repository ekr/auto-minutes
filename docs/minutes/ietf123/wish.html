<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The WISH working group meeting focused primarily on the active working group document concerning server-sent offers. Discussions revolved around the appropriate HTTP status code to use when a server responds with a counter-offer (issue #12), lifetime of offers and multi-codec support. The group also considered the discoverability of WebRTC endpoints. Several action items were identified to progress the specification.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTTP Status Code for Counter-Offers:</strong> The discussion centered around whether to use 202 (Accepted) when a server responds with a counter-offer to a client's offer. Concerns were raised that 202 might not be semantically correct. 303 (See Other) was suggested as an alternative, indicating a redirection to a new URL where the client should post its answer. 406 (Not Acceptable) was also briefly discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Offer Lifetime:</strong> The group recognized the need to specify the lifetime of server-sent offers, preventing indefinite state on the server. Existing SFU behavior was mentioned as a potential starting point. Including an &quot;expires&quot; header in the response was suggested.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Codec Support:</strong> Sergio's proposal to mandate that clients offer all supported codecs was debated. Concerns were raised about bandwidth usage on mobile devices. A compromise of using a &quot;SHOULD&quot; recommendation was suggested, along with documenting reasons for not adhering to it.</li>
<li><strong>WebRTC Endpoint Discoverability:</strong>  The group discussed the challenge of discovering WebRTC endpoints given a URL.  Options like URL schemes or a &quot;.web&quot; postfix were considered, but no consensus was reached.</li>
<li><strong>Service Sent Events:</strong>  Agreement to move server-sent events to a separate extension document.</li>
<li><strong>Timeline</strong>: Agreement that required items not addressed by the end of August will not go into V1. A potential interim meeting to address remaining issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Replace the proposed 202 status code with 303 (See Other) for counter-offers.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Dan):</strong> Update the pull request to use 303 (See Other) and document how to use it.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Dan):</strong> Investigate options for specifying offer lifetime, potentially using an &quot;expires&quot; header.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Dan):</strong> Add a &quot;SHOULD&quot; recommendation for clients to offer as many codecs as possible, including justifications for not doing so.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Chairs):</strong> Revisit the discoverability issue on the mailing list and lean on HTTP experts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dan to update the pull request with the agreed-upon changes and lifetime considerations.</li>
<li>Chairs to re-engage the mailing list regarding WebRTC endpoint discoverability.</li>
<li>Working group members to review the updated pull request.</li>
<li>Attempt to get all required items done with a PR by the end of August.</li>
<li>Consider an interim meeting in October to review progress.</li>
</ul>
