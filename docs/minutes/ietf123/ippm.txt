## Summary

The IPPM meeting in Madrid focused on updates to existing drafts and introductions of new proposals. Key discussions revolved around the quality of outcome document, encrypted PDMv2, and extensions to STAMP for ECN traversal measurement. New work proposals included a YANG model for IOM integrity and various IOM-related technologies and applications. A large number of lightning talks were scheduled, but not all were presented due to time constraints.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Quality of Outcome Update:** Bjorn presented updates to the quality of outcome draft, incorporating feedback from the working group last call. Changes included restructuring sections, adding security considerations, terminology standardization, and new references.
*   **Encrypted PDMv2:** Nalini presented an update on the encrypted PDMv2 draft, which had been returned to the working group after IESG review. The draft addresses the need to encrypt PDM data while avoiding excessive overhead. It outlined principles for registration and key management and explored existing solutions like Edgium, Radius, and Spiffy. Discussion focused on the registration process, key generation, and potential use cases.
*   **STAMP Extension for ECN Traversal Measurement:** Greg presented a merged proposal for a STAMP extension to enable bidirectional ECN traversal measurement. The proposal updates the existing class of service TLV, adding fields for ECN and return path ECN values.
*   **YANG Model for IOM Integrity:** Justin presented a YANG model extending RFC 9617 for IOM integrity protection, creating four new profiles with a field for Integrity Method.
*   **IOM Use Case Presentation:** Ingrid presented a use case for IOM within NBN, the National Broadband Network in Australia, highlighting the need for end-to-end performance visibility in a layer 2 wholesale network.
*   **Lightning Talks:**
    *   Rakeas presented a STAMP extension for BER measurement.
    *   Xiaoming presented extensions to the IOM trace option for carrying fixed-size data.
    *   Tell You presented a modified AMP algorithm to augment IOM.
    *   Tell You presented about alternate marketing message about past message.
    *   Tal Mizrahi presented a new IOM template option.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Quality of Outcome:** The working group will keep the call for review open briefly, with the expectation that it will be ready for progression soon.
*   **Encrypted PDMv2:** Authors to explore and document different approaches to key management and registration, potentially providing examples for different organizational contexts. Determine best venue for registration protocol specification.
*   **STAMP Extension for ECN Traversal Measurement:** The working group to revisit this draft for adoption in Q4, with authors encouraged to continue engaging on the mailing list.
*   **YANG Model for IOM Integrity:** The working group to revisit this draft for adoption after this session.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of PDMv2 to engage with AD and Security experts to decide on the next steps and the proper venue for registration work.
*   Authors of ECN/STAMP extension to discuss with Rakesh about the reflection drafts.
*   Authors of IOM extensions and related drafts to engage offline and on mailing lists to discuss their work.
