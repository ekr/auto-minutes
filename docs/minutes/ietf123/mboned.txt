# mboned

## Summary
The mboned meeting covered updates since the last IETF, active working group documents, and presentations on several multicast-related topics including multicast use cases in MOE architectures for LLMs, the DOMS cluster of drafts (Dorms, Cbeck, Ambi), bandwidth demands in multicast routing, web security model for multicast, multicast quick implementation, and a LISP deployment draft. Discussions centered around scalability, security, and potential adoption paths for these technologies.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Updates since last IETF:** New area director, rechartering, milestone updates, and cleanup of expired drafts.
*   **Active Working Group Documents:** Status updates on the Yang model draft and the redundant ingress failover draft, awaiting reviews and working group last calls.
*   **Multicast for LLMs (Sandy Zong):** Explored multicast use cases in Mixture of Experts (MOE) architectures for Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposed using network multicast technology to assist LLM multi-caster implementation. Discussed scalability and potential venues for further discussion (Mboned, Beer, RIFT).
*   **DOMS Cluster (Max):** Presented an overview of DOMS, Cbeck, and Ambi drafts, focusing on discovery of metadata, congestion control, and integrity for multicast streams.
    *   C-back: Discussed fairness criteria and coordination with the CCWG.
    *   Ambi: Discussed the necessity of a multicast security threat model.
*   **Demand-Aware Multicast Routing (Max):**  Discussed using bandwidth demands of senders in multicast routing decisions and whether there's operator interest in enhancing existing protocols to account for this. Mentioned P2MP RSVP as an existing technology.
*   **Web Security Model for Multicast (Kyle):** Explored adapting the web security model for multicast, addressing confidentiality and non-linkability challenges. Discussed K-anonymity, potential for open technology platforms vs. proprietary CDN solutions, and a plan to engage with the security area.
*   **Multicast Quick (Luis):** Updated the group on a multicast quick implementation, encouraging testing and discussing merging this draft with existing work, and whether Mbonded or Quick is the best home for the draft.
*   **LISP Deployment Draft (Prasad):** Briefly presented a LISP deployment draft and requested comments.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Dorms:**  The chairs will take dorms to the list for working group last call.
*   **Cbeck:**  Max to present at CCWG and ask for workgroups sometime after that.
*   **Ambi:**  Await progress on the multicar security drive before progressing.
*   **Web Security Model for Multicast (Kyle):** Chairs will take this to the list for potential adoption and coordinate with the security area.
*   **Multicast Quick (Luis):** Review Luis' proposal if it should exist in Mboned.
*   **LISP Deployment Draft (Prasad):** Take it to the list.

## Next Steps
*   Take action items to the mailing list.
*   Continue discussions in relevant working groups (Beer, RIFT, Quick, CCWG).
*   Further explore collaboration and potential merging of drafts related to multicast quick.
*   Gather more input and testing on multicast quick implementations.
