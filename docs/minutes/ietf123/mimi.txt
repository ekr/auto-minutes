## Summary

The MIMI working group held a productive session covering three main topics: content format, protocol updates, and room policy. Key presentations included updates to the MIMI content format (with a proposal to split message status into a separate document), significant protocol changes including download proxy functionality and franking improvements, and room policy enhancements. Additional presentations covered malicious hub detection mechanisms and AV metadata handling. The session emphasized the need for more implementation experience before advancing documents to working group last call.

## Key Discussion Points

### MIMI Content Format
- **Document Split**: Proposal to separate message status (read receipts, delivery notifications) from core MIMI content into two documents received rough consensus
- **Open Issues**: Six issues remain, including registry of dispositions, timestamp inconsistencies, and message ID calculation security concerns
- **Message ID Security**: Extensive discussion on potential hash collision attacks when concatenating variable-length URIs. Options considered include warning documentation, URI validation, separator characters, or CBOR framing
- **Nested Content Complexity**: Timo presented concerns about content nesting complexity, proposing simpler approaches with clear separation between messages and attachments. Rowan defended current approach citing real-world use cases like V-cards with embedded images
- **Implementation Status**: Multiple implementers reported progress, with requests for interoperability testing before working group last call

### MIMI Protocol Updates
- **Download Proxy Service**: Major addition providing three client options for asset downloads:
  - Direct HTTP download (leaks IP to asset provider)
  - Simple download proxy via hub (prevents IP leakage to asset provider)
  - Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) for maximum privacy protection
- **Security Improvements**: Added signature wrapping for key package requests to prevent provider tampering
- **Franking Changes**: Moved from HMAC to signature-based franking integrity to prevent bogus message attacks
- **Pending Proposals**: New mechanism for hub to staple invalidated proposal replacements

### Room Policy Enhancements
- **Role Management**: Discussion of asymmetric role change capabilities (e.g., admins demoting themselves but not other admins)
- **Capability System**: Questions raised about necessity of capability checks beyond authorized role changes
- **Ban Management**: Need identified for encoding ban duration and expiration information

### Additional Topics
- **Malicious Hub Detection**: Eric presented audit layer proposal using client-driven Merkle tree proofs to detect hub misbehavior without requiring hub modifications
- **AV Metadata**: Brief presentation of draft for audio/video metadata including dimensions, alt text, preview images, and duration information

## Decisions and Action Items

- **Approved**: Split of MIMI content and message status into separate documents
- **Rowan**: Will create new IANA registry for MIMI dispositions
- **Rowan**: Will collaborate with Deirdre on message ID hash algorithm encoding alternatives
- **Rowan**: Will add text clarifying message ID behavior for edited messages
- **Implementation Testing**: Call for organized interoperability testing before working group last call
- **Room Policy**: Further discussion needed on asymmetric role change capabilities

## Next Steps

- Rowan to submit updated MIMI content draft addressing resolved issues
- Working group last call consideration pending implementation experience and interoperability testing
- Continued development of download proxy specifications with implementer feedback
- Further discussion on room policy enhancements through mailing list
- Eric to revise malicious hub detection draft incorporating MLS state mechanisms
- AV metadata draft to receive community feedback before potential adoption
