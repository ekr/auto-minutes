## Summary

The CATS working group meeting at IETF 123 covered the status of working group documents (use cases, requirements, framework, and metrics) and included presentations on seven individual drafts. Discussions focused on consolidating use cases and requirements, clarifying extensibility and security in the framework, and refining metric levels and definitions. The meeting aimed to progress the working group documents towards last call and solicit feedback on individual drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Use Cases and Requirements:**
    *   Updates to the use case and requirements document focused on dynamicity, metric representation, and instance affinity.
    *   Discussion on whether to add new service-specific requirements (e.g., data synchronization for ISAC use case) to the main document or handle them separately.
    *   Debate regarding including use cases even if solutions are hard to provide.
*   **Framework:**
    *   Updates addressed comments on joint affiliation, terminology, service instances, provisioning, and management.
    *   Discussion on service announcement and security considerations.
    *   Clarification needed on the relationship between service metrics and company metrics.
    *   Concerns raised about potential DNS changes and the importance of DNS directorate review.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   Updates included design principles focusing on metric levels and the addition of aggregation and normalization functions.
    *   Discussion on introducing a new "service metrics" level and standardizing metric sizes.
    *   Hackathon results presented, showcasing metric collection and aggregation in a cloud/network environment.
*   **Individual Drafts:**
    *   Presentations covered data models, security considerations, service segmentation, mobile traffic steering, applicability to O-RAN, and DNS-based service discovery.
    *   Feedback was provided on each draft, including suggestions for improvement and alignment with working group documents.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Use Cases and Requirements:** Authors will consider adding a new subsection referencing related work in other SDOs. Chairs to help if the authors need a decision called on adding ISAC
*   **Framework:** Authors will address Zhongpeng's comments and continue discussions on service announcements and security. Further operational considerations to be added based on chairs feedback.
*   **Metrics:** Authors to consider feedback on service vs composed metrics, standardization of metric size, and to make sure metrics have a shared understanding by sender and receiver.
*   **Security Considerations Draft:** Authors should review the security sections of the Framework and Requirements drafts and consider incorporating material.
*   **DNS-based Server Discovery Draft:** Authors should address issues about name collisions, key management, authentication of dynamic DNS updates, data propagation and operational considerations.
*   **General:** All individual draft authors are encouraged to continue discussions on the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   **Working Group Documents:** Aim for working group last call for use cases, requirements, and framework documents after addressing outstanding issues.
*   **Individual Drafts:** Authors to revise drafts based on meeting feedback and continue discussions on the mailing list.
