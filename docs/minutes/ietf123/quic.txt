# quic

## Summary

This meeting covered a wide range of QUIC-related topics, including multipath, extended key update, address discovery, ACK frequency, timestamp accuracy, QUIC stream multiplexing (QMux), deadline-aware QUIC streams, optimistic acknowledgement attacks, and instant acknowledgements. Discussions focused on resolving open issues in existing drafts and exploring potential directions for future QUIC extensions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **QLog:** Updates on resolving open issues and seeking implementer feedback on usage.
*   **Reliable Resets:** Awaiting implementer interest and planning for working group last call.
*   **Load Balancers:** Still gathering deployment experience.
*   **QMux (QUIC Stream Multiplexing):**
    *   Review of June interim meeting and proposed charter modification.
    *   Discussion on security implications of QMUX over insecure streams.
    *   Exploration of various potential wire protocols including web transport over H1/H2, and native QUIC frame approaches.
    *   Discussion on the relative merits of code reuse versus performance considerations for wire protocol selection.
*   **Multipath:**
    *   Progress on addressing working group last call comments, including renaming status frames and error codes.
    *   Discussion on proposed new error codes (communication failure, poor performance, timeout) and potentially renaming `past unstable`.
    *   Decision to remove vague guidance on uncoordinated path abandonment.
    *   Discussion on token handling for multiple addresses and consideration of a formal consensus call.
*   **Extended Key Update:**
    *   Updates on synchronization with TLS extended key update work.
    *   Emphasis on the normative dependency on TLS and the importance of formal analysis.
*   **Address Discovery:** Near completion, awaiting merge of editorial PRs.
*   **ACK Frequency:**
    *   Discussion on handling of previously missing packets and potential changes to immediate ACK behavior.
    *   Clarification that current draft does not change the behavior if you have never sent an act that reports the loss.
    *   Agreement that the group wants to prevent sending act after receiving every packet in reordering case.
*   **QUIC Packet Received Timestamps:**
    *   Discussion on coexistence mechanisms for multiple ACK frame extensions and alternative approaches, including striking RFC number from here.
*   **Deadline-Aware QUIC Streams:** Seeking feedback on interest in exploring deadline-aware streams.
*   **Optimistic Acknowledgement Attacks:** Vulnerable implementations and mitigation techniques.
*   **Instant Acknowledgements:** Discussion of the potential performance implications (both positive and negative) in different scenarios.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Multipath:**
    *   Remove guidance on uncoordinated path abandonment.
    *   Authors to follow up with Martin Thompson on token handling.
    *   Consider formal consensus call on the token handling issue.
    *   Submit a new version after the meeting to resolve the issues.
    *   A short final working group last call will be done once the issues are resolved
*   **ACK Frequency:**
    *   Authors to create PR to fix sending act after receiving every packet in reordering case
    *   Further investigation/discussion is needed to fully resolve the immediate ACK behavior.
*   **QUIC Packet Received Timestamps:**
    *   Nuke the stuff about the RFC number thing and make it clear about how this extension coexists with multi-path.
*   **New Issue**
    *   Mia Kulavind to open a new issue to redesign the frame for multi path extensions.
*   **QMux:**
    *   Clarify that option D is in the new charter
    *   Authors will ensure consensus is confirmed on the list

## Next Steps

*   Authors to revise drafts based on meeting discussions.
*   Working group to follow up on open issues on the mailing list.
*   AD to proceed with IESG ballot on the charter modification.
*   Working group to consider adoption of QMUX work after charter modification.
*   Coordinate with TLS working group on extended key update standardization.
*   Consider working group last calls for drafts with resolved issues.
