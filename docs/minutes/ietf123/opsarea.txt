## Summary

This meeting covered updates from various working groups within the Operations and Management Area (opsarea). Presentations included progress reports on Autonomic Networking, Benchmarking Methodology, DNS Operations, Green Networking, Routing Operations, IoT Operations, IP Performance Measurement, Inventory Management, Multicast Operations, Media Operations, Network Configuration, Network Modeling, Network Management Operations and Protocol, Secure Inter-Domain Routing, SRV6 Operations, IPv6 Operations, AI in Network Operations, and proposed new working groups on Secure Access to TLS Local Resources and Operationalizing Network Abstractions. Additionally, there were discussions on the DNS Directorate, Performance Metrics Directorate, OPS Directorate, YANG Doctors, and an initiative to refresh RFC 5706 on operational considerations in IETF specifications. Presentations included use cases for current applications of related technologies.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **ANIMA:** Focus on secure bootstrap, IPv6 connectivity, generic signaling, and the Bruski protocol.
*   **Benchmarking Methodology (BMWG):** Revisiting old RFCs and defining methodologies for new technologies.
*   **DNSOP:** Addressing DNS vs. application interaction, including domain verification, structured DNS errors, and DNS name integration into web frameworks.
*   **Green Networking:** Adopting documents, data models, and upcoming interim meetings.
*   **GROW:** Increased activity around the BGP protocol, leadership changes.
*   **UT-Ops:** Addressing IoT operational issues, focusing on MUD related topics.
*   **IPPM:** Focusing on IOM related works and addressing security-related challenges in capacity protocol and encrypted PDMV2.
*   **INVENT:** Working on a base core model for inventory and related topics.
*   **MBONED:** Addressing gaps related to transport layer and security issues for multicast.
*   **Media Operations:** Focusing on the impacts of network overlays on streaming video.
*   **NETCONF:** Continuing work on various notification documents including yang push light, NetConf over Quick.
*   **NETMOD:** Focus on module versioning, server support for multiple versions, configuration templates, and future work on YANG versions.
*   **NMOP:** Yang Push integration with message brokers, network anomaly detection architecture, and updates to RFC 3435.
*   **OPSAWG:** Focus on OAM guidelines and contextual telemetry data.
*   **SIDROPS:** Progressing on version 2 of the RPKI protocol and ASPA.
*   **SRV6-Ops:** Documenting operational and deployment considerations for SRV6.
*   **IPv6 Operations:** Focus on IPv6-only and IPV6 transition issues.
*   **AI in Network Operations:** Discussing the application of AI and generative AI in network operations.
*   **Settle (Proposed WG):** Addressing security risks and poor user experience with TLS on local servers.
*   **Onions (Proposed WG):** Operationalizing network and service abstractions.
*   **RFC 5706 Update:** Refreshing guidelines for considering operation and management in IETF specifications.
*	**Interconnection API (PIDI):** Automation of public peering.
*	**China Telecom's API approach:** cloud network convergency and API development
*	**COAP application to telemetry:** Discussion of COAP's applicability to network telemetry, including benefits over UDP.
*	**IETF-ITU Coordination:** Process and coordination efforts between IETF and ITU-T.
*	**Host-based path failover experimentation:** Implementation details and testing results from testing host-based path failover for transport protocol.
*	**Schema-driven APIs and automation:** Automating network operations using standardized APIs and tools for schema validation.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   The plan to refresh RFC 5706 is on track, with regular meetings and progress. Feedback is solicited on the scope of the document. Target audience will be people writing the operational consideration section for specification.

## Next Steps

*   Continue development and discussion on RFC 5706 update.
*   The IAB GitHub is to be reviewed to understand the canned responses and templates that would be used for liaison statements to other organizations.
*   Continue discussions with VIM and others related to tools.
*   Continue discussing the use cases of current IETF protocols for current projects.
