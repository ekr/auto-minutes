# SUIT Meeting - IETF 123

## Summary

The SUIT working group met to discuss the status of several drafts, including suit-report, suit-update-management, suit-mti, and suit-trust-domains. Updates were provided on documents in the RFC Editor's queue.  The AD evaluator Deb Cooley outlined her plan for reviewing the remaining drafts and community provided updates on various drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Suit Report:** Brandon provided an update on suit-report-14. The draft addresses AD comments and includes a summary of changes since the last call. A new draft will be issued to correct the track (Standard vs. Informational). Media type registration needs to be submitted.
*   **Suit Update Management:** Deb Cooley will review the suit-update-management draft after completing her review of the suit-report draft.
*   **Suit MTI:** Osloon provided an update. The title has been changed to "Cryptographic Algorithms for Internet of Things Devices." Profile handling has been flattened and security considerations have been clarified. A discussion ensued regarding the inclusion of algorithms that may soon be deprecated, especially concerning post-quantum cryptography.
*   **Suit Trust Domains:** Draft has cleared IESG discussion and will be going to the editor's queue. The working group addressed ballot comments, and addressed the the title and introduction, deciding against rewriting them.
*   **RFC Editor Queue:** Authors were reminded to promptly respond to comments from the RFC Editor and IANA, as delays can significantly slow down the process.  Some comments may require responses from all authors.
*   **CDDL Syntax Check:** Osloon demonstrated a CDDL syntax check method using the `CDDOC` tool in the suit-report GitHub repository.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Suit Report:**
    *   Brandon: Issue a new draft of suit-report with the correct track (Standard).
    *   Brandon: Submit the media type registration for suit-report.
*   **Suit Update Management:**
    *   Osloon: Begin working on an update to the suit-update-management draft, taking into consideration the comments raised about algorithms and PQC.
*   **Suit Trust Domains:**
    *   No action items as the document has been approved to go to the editor.

## Next Steps

*   The SUIT working group will schedule an interim meeting via the mailing list.
