## Summary
The IVY working group meeting covered updates on base inventory, passive network inventory, and entitlement inventory models. Discussions focused on clarifying model scope, addressing open issues, and gathering feedback on proposed changes. Decisions were made regarding specific attributes and modeling approaches for the base inventory model. Concerns were raised about the scope of the passive inventory model in relation to the working group charter, requiring further review. The entitlement inventory model received positive feedback, and plans were made to develop a detailed YANG module.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Base Inventory Model:**
    *   Debate on modeling slots as components vs. attributes of a component.
    *   Discussion on whether to use a list of parent slots or a new "other parent" list to support multi-slot cards.
    *   Concerns regarding software and firmware revision attributes and their placement within the model.
    *   Clarification needed regarding the relationship between base and software inventory models.
*   **Passive Network Inventory Model:**
    *   The definition of "guiding media" and its application across various physical technology domains.
    *   The relationship between the passive inventory model and topology models.
    *   Concerns raised regarding the scope of the draft with respect to the working group charter.
*   **Entitlement Inventory Model:**
    *   Emphasis on modeling entitlements and restrictions rather than auto-discovery or enforcement.
    *   Positive feedback on the clarified scope and focus of the model.
    *   Plans to develop a detailed YANG module based on current understanding.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Base Inventory Model:**
    *   Keep the current model where slots are components.
    *   Add a new "other parent" list to support multi-slot cards.
    *   Keep the revision of the running software and patches under the network element.
    *   Report the OS name or software name for the network element in addition to software revision.
    *   Allow an hardware component to report the revision of the running software and patches of the running firmware.
    *   Keep a single software revision have a list of a software name, software rev for a component.
    *   Discuss how to represent the revision of the software (as a string or two separate release and version attributes) further on the mailing list.
*   **Passive Network Inventory Model:**
    *   Review the working group charter to confirm if the draft is within scope.
*   **Entitlement Inventory Model:**
    *   Incorporate additional feedback and proceed with developing a detailed YANG module.

## Next Steps
*   **Base Inventory Model:**
    *   Continue discussion on the mailing list to resolve remaining open issues, particularly the question on splitting the revision of software.
*   **Passive Network Inventory Model:**
    *   Chairs to review the working group charter.
    *   Address open issues.
*   **Entitlement Inventory Model:**
    *   Incorporate additional feedback.
    *   Develop a detailed YANG module.
    *   Take a sense of the working group on the mailing list.
