# regext Working Group Meeting Minutes

## Summary

The REGEXT (Registration Extension Protocols) working group met to discuss document status updates, ongoing work, and potential new work items. Key highlights included discussions on RDAP extensions for bare identifiers (a long-standing contentious issue), domain variant support for EPP, and several other protocol extensions. The working group welcomed Jorge Cano as a new co-chair and reviewed multiple documents in various stages of development.

## Key Discussion Points

### Document Status Updates
- **RFC 9803** published: DNS time-to-live values extension for EPP
- Two documents moved to RFC Editor queue: email extension for internationalized addresses and EPP deletion best practices clarification
- Multiple documents currently with IESG or in publication pipeline

### Existing Work Updates
- **JS Contact for RDAP** (Mario Lofreda): Updated to remove UID property, added profile definition, marked as experimental track
- **EPP Versioning and Transport over QUIC** (Jim Gould): Ready for working group last call, seeking quick working group feedback  
- **Transport over HTTPS** (Mario): Ready for working group last call
- **RDAP Extension for RPTI**: Incorporated feedback from SIDROPS working group, seeking RDE-level review

### RDAP Extensions - Bare Identifiers Discussion
Extensive discussion on long-standing issue of bare identifiers in RDAP extensions. Three positions presented:
1. **Disallow completely** - Make current "SHOULD" guidance a "MUST NOT"
2. **Allow freely** - Remove restrictions entirely  
3. **Compromise** - Allow only with technical justification

Arguments for disallowing included consistency, implementation feedback about problems, and protocol design guidance. Arguments for allowing included aesthetics and protocol evolution concerns. Chairs indicated preference for position 1 (disallowing) pending mailing list discussion.

### New Work Proposals

#### Domain Variant Support for EPP (Jim Gould)
- Comprehensive extension for managing related domain groups beyond just variants
- Key architectural principle: related domains must be managed by same entity
- Significant open issues around terminology (variants vs. related groups) and command consistency
- Request for working group adoption, pending broader review

#### Grace Period Extension Update (Rick Wilhelm)  
- Updating RFC 3915 to fix schema/documentation mismatch
- Minimal targeted change requiring new namespace
- Ready for working group consideration

#### EPP Extension Registry Improvements (Scott Hollenbeck/Gavin Brown)
- Identified issues with existing registry entries (problematic URN namespaces)
- Proposed improvements to evaluation criteria and expert review process
- Encouraging cleanup of existing problematic entries

#### RDAP Verification Extension (Mario Lofreda)
- New extension to display contact verification status information
- Supports compliance requirements like EU NIS II Directive
- Seeking working group interest and adoption

## Decisions and Action Items

- **Chairs**: Take EPP Transport over QUIC document to QUIC working group for feedback
- **Chairs**: Prepare working group last call for Transport over HTTPS document  
- **Chairs**: Prepare working group last call for EPP Transport over QUIC document
- **Chairs**: Take bare identifiers discussion to mailing list with proposal to disallow (position 1)
- **Working Group**: Review JS Contact for RDAP with focus on profile definitions and search path implications
- **Working Group**: Provide broader review of domain variants document, particularly from internationalization perspective
- **All**: Submit feedback on various new work proposals via mailing list

## Next Steps

1. Mailing list discussion on bare identifiers with chairs' proposal to disallow
2. Broader review of domain variants proposal before formal adoption consideration  
3. Working group last calls for transport-related documents
4. Continued development of verification extension based on community feedback
5. Registry cleanup efforts for existing EPP extension entries
6. Coordination with other working groups (QUIC, SIDROPS) as appropriate
