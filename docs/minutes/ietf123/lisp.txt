## Summary

The LISP working group meeting covered the status of several documents, including RFC8060bis, the LISP YANG model, multicast deployment, and the joint attributes document. Discussions focused on the progression of these documents toward standards track, addressing open issues, and future work items. The meeting also touched on potential new areas of work for the working group, including multicast quick and agent mobility.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RFC8060bis (LCAF):**
    *   Discussion centered around the "unapproved types" defined in the original RFC.
    *   Four types have confirmed implementations and will be included.
    *   Consensus reached to include the remaining two types (opaque key and non-locator) even if implementations haven't been reported.
    *   Future assignments are specification required.
*   **LISP YANG Model:**
    *   The plan is to incorporate geo-coordinates and vendor-specific LCAFs, following the RFC8060bis evolution.
    *   A working group last call will be initiated after these updates.
*   **Multicast Deployment Draft:**
    *   Significant rewrites were done, especially linking to the "uberlay" draft.
    *   The draft now depends on the list "uberlay" draft.
    *   Guidance needed on how to request adoption of the "uberlay" draft.
*   **Joint Attributes Draft (8059/9798):**
    *   The aim is to merge 8059 and 9798 into a single standards-track document.
    *   No functional changes are intended.
    *   IANA code points will be reused from the existing experimental RFCs.
*   **New Work Items:**
    *   **Multicast Quick:** Discussion on whether to explore multicast quick as a mechanism for the mapping system.
    *   **Agent Mobility:** Discussion on whether to address the mobility of software agents in the context of interoperability with legacy devices.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **RFC8060bis:** Include all previously "unapproved types" in the updated RFC and registry.
    *   **Action:** Alvaro to incorporate working group feedback into version 03, add operational considerations, prepare for working group last call.
*   **LISP YANG Model:** Update the YANG model with geo-coordinates and vendor-specific LCAFs.
    *   **Action:** Alberto to coordinate with Alvaro on RFC8060bis releases and update the YANG model accordingly.
*   **Multicast Deployment Draft:** Seek guidance on the adoption process for the "uberlay" draft.
    *   **Action:** Prasad to seek guidance on how to request adoption of the uberlay draft.
*   **New Work Items:** Open discussion on the mailing list regarding multicast quick and agent mobility.
    *   **Action:** Dino to start threads on the mailing list to solicit interest and volunteers for multicast quick and agent mobility.

## Next Steps

*   Alvaro to update RFC8060bis and prepare for working group last call.
*   Alberto to update the LISP YANG model.
*   Prasad to follow up on the uberlay draft adoption process.
*   Dino to initiate discussions on the mailing list regarding multicast quick and agent mobility.
