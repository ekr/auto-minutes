## Summary

The ACME working group meeting covered document status updates, presentations on several draft proposals, and discussions regarding their direction and potential adoption. Key topics included client authentication challenges, auto-discovery of ACME servers, public key challenges, ACME RATS integration, JWT claim constraints in STIR certificates, ACME profiles and persistent DNS validation.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Status:**
    *   Two new RFCs published: RFC 9773 (ARI) and RFC 9799 (Onion).
    *   Several drafts are in the RFC editor's queue or undergoing revisions.
*   **Client Authentication Challenge Types:**
    *   Discussion on the usefulness and implementation status of the client challenge type draft.
    *   Concerns were raised about the scope and potential overlap with other drafts, particularly concerning WebAuthn.
    *   Debate on whether this represents a fundamental change to ACME.
*   **Auto-Discovery of ACME Servers:**
    *   Discussion on the need for auto-discovery mechanisms for different identifier types, including those beyond DNS names.
    *   The draft is looking for a new lead author who can champion adoption, especially someone from a major vendor.
*   **Public Key Challenges:**
    *   The presenter clarified that the use case in this scenario is for enterprise or campus contexts.
    *   Concerns were raised about the practical necessity and security model of the proposed solution.
*   **ACME RATS Integration:**
    *   Discussion about combining the RATS process with the ACME process to improve device security.
    *   Debate on where the attestation information should be placed within the Acme protocol flow (challenge vs. order payload).
*   **Extension of Public Key Challenges for JWT claim constraints**:
    *   A question was raised about handling multiple challenges with different authorities.
*   **Persistent DNS Validation in ACME:**
    *   Discussion on implementing static TXT records for DNS validation.
    *   Emphasis on aligning with the CA/Browser Forum's efforts on this front.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Client Authentication Challenge Types:** Kathleen will address the feedback and decide whether a new draft should be uploaded. Chairs to start a mailing list thread on this.
*   **Auto-Discovery of ACME Servers:** Mike is looking for someone from a CA or CSP to take lead of this draft.
*   **ACME RATS Integration:** Discuss placing attestation result into the order payload in the main list.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion of open issues on the mailing list.
*   Coordinate efforts on similar drafts (e.g., client authentication challenges, persistent DNS validation) to avoid duplication and ensure alignment.
*   Continue the Akimirat design team meeting to discuss design and potentially call for adoption in Montreal.
