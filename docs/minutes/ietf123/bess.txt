## Summary
The BESS working group meeting covered a range of topics, including working group status updates, updates on existing drafts, and presentations on individual drafts related to EVPN and related technologies. Key discussion points included error handling in BGP, multi-homing scenarios, load balancing, and fabric migration. Several drafts were presented, with requests for working group adoption.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Working Group Status:** Six new RFCs published since the last IETF. Several drafts are in IESG review or working group last call. Need for editors to ensure drafts do not expire. Rechartering and milestones update completed.
*   **RFC 7432bis (EVPN):** Discussion on VLAN bundle model, error handling (especially regarding NLRIs and attributes), and route resolution. Concerns about the diff between 7432 and 7432bis were discussed. Request for working group last call.
*   **EVPN Per Multicast Flow DF Election:** Presentation on using HRW algorithm for per-flow DF election. Implementation exists and authors believe the draft is ready for WG last call. Addressed AC's comments.
*   **EVPN on Equal Low Balance:** Update on addressing comments from IDR and BESS regarding the EVPN link bandwidth extended community and its coexistence with the BGP link bandwidth extended community. Request to repeat working group last call.
*   **EVPN Nangas Multi-homing:** Presentation on using anycast VTEPs for multi-homed leaves. Updates include settling on the encoding of the anycast VTEP in the BGP tunnel encapsulation attribute and adding support for layer 3 inter-subnet forwarding. Request for working group adoption.
*   **EVPN Fabric Migration:** Update on seamless migration of EVPN fabric from IPv4 to IPv6 (and vice-versa). Focused on operational considerations and changes to keep the originator IP address the same. Request for working group opinions.
*   **EVPN L3 Optimized IRB:** Introduced a new option, option C, is proposed to discover a host through the BGP control plane.
*   **Unknown Mac Route (UMR):** Expanded coverage to include new use cases and ARP/ND proxy. Clarified procedures and modes of operation. Request for working group adoption.
*   **Mobile User Plane SAFI:** Presentation of a new BGP SAFI for carrying mobile user plane information. Multiple implementations exist. Request for working group adoption.
*   **Anycast SRv6 Policy Identifier:** Introduction of a new flag in the service TLV for the SRv6 to indicate this is anycast identifier.
*   **Layer 3 Access EVPN Services:** Updates and discussion on layer 3 access interfaces for EVPN services, including traffic isolation using LSI. Concerns were raised about potential overlap with existing solutions.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **RFC 7432bis:** Sasha to review the changes and provide feedback. Chairs will consider sending the draft to the IDR list for feedback. Authors to provide concise one-liner summary of updates.
*   **EVPN on Equal Low Balance:** Repeat working group last call.
*   **EVPN Nangas Multi-homing:** Request for working group adoption.
*   **EVPN Fabric Migration:** Request for feedback from the working group.
*   **Unknown Mac Route (UMR):** Request for working group adoption.
*   **Mobile User Plane SAFI:** Request for working group adoption. Jeffrey Zahn will send a note out to the working group with his thoughts.
*   **Anycast SRv6 Policy Identifier:** Request for adoption.
*   **Layer 3 Access EVPN Services:** Authors to compare their solution with existing ones and provide a packet walkthrough to clarify the procedures.

## Next Steps
*   Follow up on action items.
*   Continue discussion on mailing lists for individual drafts.
*   Address comments and incorporate feedback into draft revisions.
*   Schedule working group last calls and adoption calls as appropriate.
