## Summary

The DNSSD working group met to discuss charter updates, multiple Q types document status, Time Since Received (TSR) open issues, advertising proxy issues, and potential improvements to DNS SIG(0). Key accomplishments include the recent publication of SRP and update lease as RFCs in October 2024. The group reviewed numerous technical issues for TSR and advertising proxy documents, with plans to continue discussions on the mailing list.

## Key Discussion Points

### Charter Update
- Current charter is 6 years old with 300+ words that need refreshing
- New charter will cover active documents and maintenance of existing protocols
- Suggestion to complete multiple Q types document before rechartering to simplify the process
- Need to include scope for protocol maintenance and quality improvements discovered during implementation

### Multiple Q Types Document
- Document is ready for last call
- Outstanding issues from Tommy Jensen need resolution
- Process will continue with shepherd write-up and AD review

### Time Since Received (TSR) Issues
- Document converted from XML to Markdown format for easier contributions
- Major focus on terminology clarification and harmonization
- Key terminology issues:
  - Unifying "requester" vs "registrant" usage (recommendation to use "registrant")
  - Defining MDNS registrar, SRP registrar, and their relationships
  - Clarifying local vs remote entity roles
- Technical issues discussed:
  - Device switching network interfaces (mesh to Wi-Fi) and service registration conflicts
  - Probe optimization when information already exists in cache
  - Handling incomplete data split across multiple MDNS packets
  - Using time of receipt vs time of processing for timestamps

### Advertising Proxy Issues
- Resolved QD count issue
- TTL value considerations need clarification beyond standard MDNS advice
- **Decision**: Remove complex subdomain hierarchy solution for name conflicts due to compatibility issues with applications like Matter
- **Decision**: Change link-local address advertisement from "must always advertise" to "must not advertise" when link cannot be determined
- SRP replication authority state considerations for when to advertise

### DNS SIG(0) Improvements
- Donald Eastlake presented potential improvements to RFC 2931
- Current draft (2931bis) adds error field, ID field via EDNS option, forwarding server handling, and multiple SIG(0) support
- Show of hands indicated interest in working on SIG(0) improvements
- Question raised about charter scope for this work

## Decisions and Action Items

### Decisions Made
- Remove complex subdomain hierarchy text from advertising proxy document for name conflict resolution
- Change link-local address advertisement requirement from "must" to "must not" when link cannot be determined
- Use "registrant" terminology consistently instead of mixing "requester" and "registrant"

### Action Items
- Tommy Jensen to clarify his outstanding issues with multiple Q types document
- Chairs to follow up on multiple Q types shepherd write-up and AD review process
- ESCO to continue terminology clarification work on TSR document
- Working group members to review TSR technical issues on GitHub and provide feedback on mailing list
- Resolve advertising proxy issues through mailing list discussions
- Continue DNS SIG(0) improvement discussions (charter scope to be determined)

## Next Steps

- Multiple Q types document to proceed through final IETF publication process
- TSR document editing to continue with terminology improvements and technical issue resolution
- Advertising proxy document to be updated based on decisions made
- Charter update process to begin, incorporating lessons learned and future work scope
- Follow-up presentation on full service DNSSD server at SNACK meeting (side meeting cancelled)
- Continue technical discussions on mailing list for all open issues
