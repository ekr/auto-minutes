<h1>CFRG Meeting Minutes - IETF 123</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The CFRG meeting at IETF 123 featured discussions on hybrid key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), post-quantum KEMs including Intrue and Classic McEliece, updates on blind signatures, zero-knowledge proofs for small identity theorems, Sigma Protocols, AEAD algorithms, and post-quantum password authenticated key exchange (PAKE). A key focus was on defining the problems that CFRG should address, balancing security and performance, and determining the appropriate venue for standardization work.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hybrid KEMs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussion centered around the trade-offs between different combiner constructions (GHP, pre, QSF).</li>
<li>A question was raised whether to proceed with three different combiners or consolidate.</li>
<li>Deterministic key generation and hash function selection (SHA2 vs. SHA3) were debated in the context of the LAMPS draft.</li>
<li>It was suggested that an interim meeting would be beneficial to refine this draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Post-Quantum KEMs (Intrue and Classic McEliece):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Debate around problem definition - what problem(s) would be solved by standardizing more PQ KEMs in CFRG beyond NIST selections?</li>
<li>Is CFRG the correct venue to pursue this work or should it be done in a different group, possibly even at the IETF instead of the IRTF?</li>
<li>Need for a requirements document to guide the selection of PQ KEMs.</li>
<li>Discussion of whether engineers have the tools to choose KEMs for their specific needs.</li>
<li>Security and performance comparisons between Intrue, McEliece, and other KEMs.</li>
<li>Concerns about the mathematical assumptions and their implications if one is broken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Blind Signatures:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updates on the core scheme and pseudonym functionalities.</li>
<li>Concern about compromised privacy due to the potential for discrete logarithm computation.</li>
<li>A polynomial approach was suggested to mitigate this issue by introducing multiple pseudonyms, but that introduced a proof size increase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Small Identity Theorems:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Need to research and develop post-quantum zero-knowledge schemes suitable for applications like digital identity wallets and age verification.</li>
<li>Discussion on the level of abstraction needed to create usable tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sigma Protocols:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Update on progress since last meeting, including call for adoption.</li>
<li>Clarification regarding the scope and relationship between the Sigma Protocol and Fiat-Shamir transform specifications.</li>
<li>Debate over which curves should be supported.</li>
<li>A push to limit the complexity and scope to encourage interoperability, while still allowing for extensions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>AEAD Algorithms (Roka-S and Chacha20-Poly1305):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Presentation of new parallel modes for Roka-S for performance improvement.</li>
<li>Proposal to update Chacha20-Poly1305 for enhanced security and performance using Poly 1.1, to include other properties defined in RFC 9771</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Post-Quantum PAKEs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Presentation of a hybrid post-quantum password authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol named Spacequake.</li>
<li>Considered the interest in the protocol, and if it should be handled in CFRG or a seperate IETF working group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Virtual Interim Meeting:</strong> The Chairs will take to the list the suggestion to have a virtual interim meeting in September to move the Hybrid KEM draft along.</li>
<li><strong>Meta-Analysis Draft:</strong> There was not anyone at the meeting, but the Chairs are open to the list suggesting someone who will perform a meta-analysis comparing the security reductions and proofs of different candidate KEMs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors of hybrid KEM drafts to address feedback from the list and meeting, and aim for a new draft version within a month.</li>
<li>The list to determine the next steps of the post quantum KEM suggestions.</li>
<li>Authors to refine draft for Sigma Protocols following the feedback.</li>
<li>Take feedback from the discussion to the list to determine interest in a work item for post-quantum PAKEs</li>
</ul>
