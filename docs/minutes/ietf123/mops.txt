## Summary

This meeting covered updates on the network overlay impacts document, the Streaming Video Technology Alliance (SVTA), BT's deployment of multicast-assisted unicast delivery (MAUD), and Cloudflare's deployment experiences with Media over QUIC (MoQ). The meeting focused on problem statements, solutions, and future plans in each area.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Network Overlay Impacts:**
    *   Review of the updated document (version 2).
    *   Discussion on potential unintended consequences of network overlays on streaming workflows, DNS resolution, and IP address assignment.
    *   Emphasis on the need for more reviews and feedback from the community.
*   **Streaming Video Technology Alliance (SVTA):**
    *   Update on SVTA's activities, including the recent Segments conference.
    *   Discussion on the SVTA's QUIC Proof of Concept (PoC) and its findings regarding CPU utilization.
    *   Announcement of an IAB workshop on IP Geolocation and SVTA's involvement.
*   **BT's Multicast Assisted Unicast Delivery (MAUD):**
    *   Presentation of MAUD as a solution to peak bandwidth demands caused by streaming events.
    *   Description of MAUD's architecture, which aims to integrate with existing CDNs and OTT services without modifying player applications.
    *   Discussion of initial trial results and future research directions, including low latency and personalized advertising.
*   **Cloudflare's Media over QUIC (MoQ) Deployment:**
    *   Overview of MoQ's position in the media technology landscape, aiming to bridge the gap between HTTP-based and RTC-based technologies.
    *   Explanation of the implementation challenges, particularly the need for system integration and refactoring.
    *   Call for community involvement in measurement, validation, and feedback to the MoQ specification.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Network Overlay Impacts Document:** Community to review the document and provide feedback via GitHub PR, SVTA survey, or the mops mailing list.
*   **SVTA QUICK POC** Publication of new results will be advertised in Montreal
*   **IAB IP GEO workshop:** Community to consider submitting a paper.
*   **MAUD:** BT to explore the Tree DM for future implementations.

## Next Steps

*   Continue working on the network overlay impacts document based on community feedback.
*   Further SVTA activities, including the Segments conference in Montreal.
*   BT to continue product trial and implementation of MAUD, exploring low latency and personalized advertising solutions.
*   Cloudflare to continue MoQ development and integration, seeking community involvement and feedback.
