## Summary

The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) session at IETF focused on various topics, including AI applications in networking, intent-based networking frameworks, and the use of large language models (LLMs) for network management. The session included presentations on existing drafts and proposals for new research directions, with a significant emphasis on agentic AI and LLMs. Discussions centered on defining key terms, validating network configurations, and addressing security concerns.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **AI in Networking:** Presentations and discussions covered the application of AI for network services, security, and management.
*   **Intent-Based Networking (IBN):** Several presentations focused on frameworks for translating high-level intent into executable network policies, with emphasis on using natural language and LLMs.
*   **Network Digital Twins (NDT):** The integration of NDTs with AI agents for AI-driven network operations was explored.  NDTs were highlighted as analytical tools.
*   **Agentic AI and LLMs:** A significant portion of the session was dedicated to agentic AI, with discussions around defining terminology, architecture, and the role of agents in network management.  A key point of discussion revolved around defining the differences between AI Agents and Agentic AI within the context of network management.
*   **Security and Validation:** The importance of validating network configurations generated by AI agents was emphasized, highlighting the need for both syntax and semantic validation.  Security concerns related to LLMs, such as vulnerability to DDoS attacks, were raised.
*   **Test Automation**: Automated protocol testing frameworks and automation levels were discussed and introduced.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **NDT Draft Progression:**  Determine the next steps for the existing NDT group draft, including potential advancement to RFC status or establishing it as a permanent reference.  The chair will need to discuss with the draft authors if they are willing to perform a last call, or if they have any remaining updates.
*   **Organize Follow-up Meeting:** Plan a follow-up interim meeting and a session at the next IETF meeting in Montreal to continue discussions on AI in network management.
*   **Continue Online Discussion:**  Encourage continued discussion on the mailing list regarding key topics like NDTs, IBN enhancements, agentic AI architecture, and protocol matching.

## Next Steps

*   Organize a follow-up interim meeting to discuss agentic AI and LLMs in greater detail.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list regarding key research questions and engineering challenges.
*   Consider developing a terminology document to define key terms related to AI and agentic AI in the context of network management.
