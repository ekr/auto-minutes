## Summary

Joint session between the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) and IP Performance Measurement Working Group (IPPM). The session covered updates on existing working group documents, new proposed work, and fostered cross-working group collaboration. Key highlights included progress on asymmetrical packets measurement, segment routing benchmarking, responsiveness testing with L4S deployment results, and several new draft proposals for energy efficiency and network testing methodologies.

## Key Discussion Points

### Working Group Document Updates

- **MLR Search Draft**: Successfully submitted to IESG for publication with recent improvements addressing reviewer comments
- **Asymmetrical Packets (IPPM)**: Completed working group last call with productive feedback incorporated, including new conformance flags and operational considerations
- **Segment Routing Benchmarking**: Stable version 04 published addressing comments from Boris and Dan, preparing for working group last call
- **Container Infrastructure Benchmarking**: Ready for working group last call after addressing mailing list feedback on CNI configurations
- **Responsiveness Testing**: Major milestone achieved with L4S deployment showing 10x improvement in working latency on Comcast networks

### Technical Discussions

- **OAM Characterization**: Extensive discussion on proposed terminology changes, particularly around "in-packet" classification as subset of "hybrid" OAM
- **STAMP Extensions**: Progress on reflecting IP headers and MPLS headers with open source implementations
- **Network Tester Configuration**: Stable YANG data model ready for working group last call with multiple implementations including open source RFC 2544 testing

### New Proposed Work

- **Source Address Validation Benchmarking**: Updated with false positive/negative rates and resource utilization metrics
- **Energy Efficiency Benchmarking**: Methodology for power consumption testing in networking devices
- **Multiple IP Address Benchmarking**: Simple proposal for using multiple IP addresses in RFC 2544 testing
- **Time Measurement Calibration**: Methodology for calibrating timestamp accuracy in network elements
- **Computing-Aware Traffic Steering (CATS)**: New benchmarking approach for computer network metrics

## Decisions and Action Items

### Working Group Last Calls
- Container infrastructure benchmarking document to proceed to working group last call
- Network tester configuration document to proceed to working group last call
- Segment routing benchmarking targeting working group last call next IETF

### Document Adoptions
- Multiple adoption requests received for STAMP extensions (IP headers and MPLS headers)
- Source address validation benchmarking identified as candidate for adoption
- Multiple IP address benchmarking requesting adoption

### Review Actions
- OAM characterization document authors to clarify terminology overlap with RFC 7799
- Energy efficiency draft to add subsystem definitions and alignment with Green WG
- Missing presenters to send summaries to mailing lists for feedback

## Next Steps

- Chairs will review adoption requests and prioritize working group last calls after the meeting
- IPPM will hold additional session on Thursday for remaining IPPM-specific topics
- Authors encouraged to engage with mailing lists for document feedback before formal calls
- Evaluation of joint session format based on participant feedback for future meetings
- Several authors planning hackathon activities for Montreal meeting

The joint session successfully facilitated cross-working group discussion and identified areas of common interest between BMWG and IPPM communities.
