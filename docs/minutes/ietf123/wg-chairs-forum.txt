# WG Chairs Forum

## Summary

The Working Group Chairs Forum at IETF 123 covered three main topics: updates from the RFC Production Center (RPC) on process improvements and new tools, guidance from the IAB Liaison coordination team on managing liaison statements with external organizations, and a practical demonstration of using GitHub for working group document management. Key discussions focused on improving document production efficiency, clarifying liaison processes, and best practices for repository management.

## Key Discussion Points

### RFC Production Center Updates (Gene Mahoney)
- **Strategic Transformations**: RPC identified key areas for improvement including productivity, process efficiency, tooling, and transparency
- **New Intake Form**: Introduction of a short questionnaire for authors when documents enter the queue to capture style guidance and contentious sections
- **Markdown Support**: Limited pilot program accepting first 5 small, non-complicated Markdown documents with two-step approval process (content review, then formatting approval)
- **Tooling Improvements**: 
  - New editing software built on VS Code libraries with built-in checkers and GitHub integration
  - New queue management system for better document status visibility
  - Website revamp targeting general RFC users
- **GitHub Integration**: Phase 1 involves RPC moving to Git/GitHub for internal version control; Phase 2 will offer optional author interaction via GitHub while maintaining email-based final review
- **Citation Specialist**: Ted Harrison introduced as new resource for improving external reference guidance and bibxml service

### IAB Liaison Coordination (Suresh and Media)
- **Formal vs Informal Communication**: Liaison statements not always required - informal communication often sufficient unless other organization has formal requirements
- **Purpose Clarification**: Three simplified purposes for liaison statements: informational (no reply needed), for action (reply requested), and in response (replying to previous statement)
- **Consensus Requirements**: Chairs determine appropriate consensus level; often no additional consensus needed beyond existing RFC consensus
- **Process Guidelines**:
  - Always consult liaison manager before sending statements
  - All statements must be publicly recorded
  - Chairs can send statements directly via Datatracker with AD approval
  - Received statements should be routed through liaison managers when possible

### GitHub Management for Working Groups (Martin)
- **Repository Creation**: Demonstrated creating working group organizations following IETFWG-[shortname] convention
- **Access Management**: Showed how to set up teams and manage collaborator access to repositories
- **Repository Transfer**: Discussed challenges and best practices for moving individual draft repositories to working group organizations
- **Discussion Management**: Addressed balancing GitHub issues vs mailing list discussions, with recommendation to use GitHub as issue tracker while maintaining substantive discussion on mailing lists

## Decisions and Action Items

### RPC Actions
- Implement intake form process with 3-week response window
- Begin Markdown pilot program with first 5 qualifying documents
- Continue development of new tooling and queue management system
- Proceed with GitHub integration phases

### Liaison Coordination Actions
- Continue RFC 4053bis update to simplify liaison statement processes
- Improve liaison tooling interface
- Provide office hours for additional questions and support

### GitHub Management Actions
- Martin to provide follow-up email with detailed instructions for organization privilege settings
- Continue discussion on mailing list regarding GitHub best practices and training materials

## Next Steps

- **RPC Community Call**: August 20th for ongoing project updates
- **Liaison Office Hours**: Available for additional questions and guidance
- **GitHub Training**: Further discussion needed on training materials for working group chairs
- **Mailing List Follow-up**: Continued discussion of GitHub management practices and policies

The session concluded with recognition that additional training and guidance materials are needed for working group chairs managing GitHub repositories and liaison relationships.
