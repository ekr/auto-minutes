<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The MASQUE working group meeting covered several key topics, including updates on existing drafts (Quick Aware Proxying, CONNECT UDP Bind, CONNECT Ethernet, DNS Configuration), discussion of ECN and DSCP support for CONNECT UDP, and a discussion about the future of the working group and its charter. Discussions focused on technical details, interop testing, and the appropriate venues for future extensions.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick Aware Proxying:</strong> Updates included handling of server preferred addresses, security considerations related to the Scramble Transform (ECB usage), and interop testing results. The group generally agreed with the current approach, with minor suggestions for clarifying documentation.</li>
<li><strong>CONNECT UDP Bind:</strong> Updates included changes to asterisk encoding, and discussion of open issues related to proxy behavior, PMTU considerations, and the default target host/port. The group debated the need for a separate compression acknowledgment capsule, ultimately deciding to implement a single-byte capsule change that was already planned.</li>
<li><strong>CONNECT Ethernet:</strong> Discussions focused on clarifying the scope of the draft, particularly regarding broadcast and multicast frames, and the need for more interop testing. There were concerns about whether to proceed on the standards track without more interrupt testing and potential concerns regarding what is considered ethernet.</li>
<li><strong>DNS Configuration:</strong> Updates included the removal of DNS request capsules. The group discussed whether to expand the draft to include a Pref64 capsule for IPv6-only networks. There was a suggestion to clarify in the draft that DNS assignments don't invalidate cached entries from previous configurations.</li>
<li><strong>ECN and DSCP Support for CONNECT UDP:</strong> The group discussed the use cases and potential complexities of supporting ECN and DSCP, including how to handle the chaining of extensions and the impact on context ID space. Multiple approaches to composition of new UDP proxy payloads were discussed. A strong signal was provided for adopting a combined draft in this area.</li>
<li><strong>Working Group Charter and Future:</strong> The group discussed the possibility of re-chartering the working group with a narrower scope, potentially sunsetting it after addressing specific remaining items like compression. The group discussed appropriate venues for further extensions to the protocols, like HTTPBis or Int-area groups.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick Aware Proxying:</strong> Incorporate feedback on the use of ECB into the draft with explicit references to RFC9001. Cut a new revision soon.</li>
<li><strong>CONNECT UDP Bind:</strong> Implement Martin's suggestion of changing the capsule renumbering to a single byte to align better with the other drafts. Add clarification for strings and tokens.</li>
<li><strong>CONNECT Ethernet:</strong> Gary will provide Github PR for Section 7, to clarify boundaries of the specifications.</li>
<li><strong>DNS Configuration:</strong> Add language to the draft stating that new DNS assignments do not invalidate cached entries. Consider title and abstract changes if the Pref64 capsule is added.</li>
<li><strong>ECN and DSCP Support for CONNECT UDP:</strong> Martin and Magnus will work on a combined draft, taking into account the issues raised. Working group signal to adopt work in this space.</li>
<li><strong>Working Group Charter:</strong> Discuss the proposed re-chartering further on the mailing list. Define precise language.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to incorporate feedback into revised drafts.</li>
<li>Continue discussions regarding ECN and DSCP support and other extensions on the mailing list.</li>
<li>Circulate proposed re-chartering language for discussion.</li>
<li>Pursue further interop testing for all drafts, where possible.</li>
</ul>
