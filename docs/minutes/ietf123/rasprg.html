<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 23 Jul 2025 07:30</p>
<h1>rasprg</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The RASPRG session covered three presentations. First, Jeffrey Ding presented research on US-China economic interdependence in standards setting. Second, Brian Newbold discussed interoperation in the AT protocol ecosystem. Finally, Karim Atumani Muhammad presented on quantifying barriers to African participation in IETF standardization.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US-China Interdependence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Jeffrey Ding presented data suggesting economic interdependence between the US and China in IETF standards is increasing, despite narratives of decoupling.</li>
<li>Discussion centered on whether RFC co-authorship accurately reflects economic relationships and investment in global interoperable standards.</li>
<li>Suggestions were made to consider deployment and adoption of standards as additional indicators of interdependence.</li>
<li>The relevance of Chinese national policies on standardization was discussed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>AT Protocol Ecosystem:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Brian Newbold discussed Blue Sky's efforts to standardize the AT protocol, including considerations for venue (IETF, W3C, or a new foundation).</li>
<li>Challenges in balancing product development with protocol standardization were highlighted.</li>
<li>Concerns about maintaining credible neutrality and avoiding corporate dominance in the ecosystem were raised.</li>
<li>The need for expertise in security, extensibility, and protocol evolution within a standards body was noted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>African Participation in IETF:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Karim Atumani Muhammad presented on barriers to African participation in the IETF, including geographic, linguistic, and structural challenges.</li>
<li>Proposals were made to track regional participation statistics, translate documentation, and promote author diversity.</li>
<li>The importance of engaging with African academia and youth communities was emphasized.</li>
<li>The economics of participation and the need for funding and career pathways were discussed.</li>
<li>The role of industry engagement in driving standards development and deployment was highlighted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jeffrey Ding:</strong> Consider incorporating deployment/adoption data and exploring country-specific trends in network analysis. Talk to people and figure out why people become co-authors, for a good understanding of the topic.</li>
<li><strong>Brian Newbold:</strong> No specific action items, but the presentation served as a valuable exploration of the challenges and considerations involved in standardizing a rapidly evolving protocol ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Karim Atumani Muhammad:</strong> Continue work on the internet draft outlining barriers to African participation and strategies for improvement.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Encourage further discussion and collaboration on the topics presented in the RASPRG mailing list and at future meetings.</li>
<li>RASPRG to consider future research on participation statistics and inclusive outreach.</li>
</ul>
