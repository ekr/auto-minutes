## Summary

The LSR working group meeting covered a range of topics, including updates on existing RFCs and drafts, discussions on new draft adoptions, and presentations on experimental work related to flood reduction, energy-aware routing, SRv6 in bundled links, and source address validation. Key discussions revolved around the prioritization of Yang model drafts, the experimental nature of certain flooding reduction techniques, the relevance and implementation of energy consumption metrics, the potential for SRv6 advertisement conflicts, and solutions for OSPF adjacency issues.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Yang Model Prioritization:** The group discussed prioritizing the last call for Flex Algorithm Yang models due to requests from the IESG and the need for a base model for future Flex Algorithm drafts.
*   **Experimental Flooding Drafts:** Concerns were raised regarding the complexity and lack of multiple implementations for flooding reduction drafts. A general consensus emerged to classify such drafts as experimental unless multiple vendors demonstrated interoperability.
*   **Distributed Flood Reduction:**  Tony P. presented empirical results of Distributed Flood Reduction experimentation. Discussion included benefits in CPU utilization and reduction of transmission volume during LSP storms. Standard tracking status was discussed.
*   **Hierarchical LSA Flooding:** Tony P. presented proposed solutions for optimizing large IS-IS networks with merkle-trees, or a hierarchy of hashes, for identifying portions of an LSDB that require synchronization.
*   **Energy-Aware Routing:** Luis presented a draft on energy-aware routing, proposing TLV extensions for reporting energy consumption metrics. Discussions focused on the granularity of metrics, the need for power adjustment values, and the overall impact on network stability. Peter advocated using existing IGP mechanisms.
*   **SRv6 in Bundled Links:** Jodong presented a draft on advertising SRv6 SRV6C for layer two bundle member links in IGP. Concerns were raised about potential conflicts with existing specifications and the necessity of introducing a new mechanism.
*   **OSPF Adjacency Separation:** Liam presented another OSPF adjacency separation document. Working group advocated that the authors combine efforts and attempt to solve the problem with one document.
*   **Subnet Requirements (SAVNET):** Lan Cheng presented a gap analysis of source address validation in intra-domain networks. The goal was to inform LSR of requirements the SAVNET working group is uncovering.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Flex Algorithm Yang Model Last Call:** The working group agreed to prioritize last calling the Flex Algorithm Yang models.
*   **Experimental Flooding Drafts:** The group will continue to evaluate drafts involving complicated flooding mechanisms as experimental, pending evidence of multiple vendor implementation and interoperability.
*   **OSPF Adjacency Separation:** Wei and A.C. will work to combine both OSPF adjacency documents into a singular solution.

## Next Steps

*   **Authors** to update drafts based on the feedback received during the meeting.
*   **Working group members** to review the presented drafts and provide comments on the mailing list, especially regarding the energy-aware routing and subnet requirements documents.
