## Summary
The EMU working group session at IETF 123 covered several topics related to EAP methods and their enhancements. Presentations were given on the EAP ad hoc draft, EAP Privacy Pass Token (EPPT), post-quantum enhancements for EAP-AKA' and EAP-TLS, a proposal for a new TEAP version (TEAPv2), Post-Quantum Authenticated Key Exchange, EAP Onboarding. Also discussed were the secure transport of DHCP Options via TEAP and some additional enhancements. The session involved discussion of technical details, potential implementation challenges, and next steps for each draft.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **EAP ad hoc:** Channel binding and clarification of EAD fields.
*   **EPPT:** Status update after working group adoption, seeking feedback, and potential implementation interest
*   **EAP-AKA' and EAP-TLS:** Reference updates, KDF updates, IANA considerations, fragmentation concerns and potential code implementation needs.
*   **TEAPv2:** Simplification of key derivation, use of TLS exporter or PRF, and the need for updated implementations and testings, a move from standardizing existing bad and broken implementations to documenting a new implementation.
*   **PEAKE (Post-Quantum Authenticated Key Exchange):** Integration into EAP ad hoc and other protocols. Optimizations for communication-constrained devices.
*   **EAP Onboarding:** Standardized way for device to securely reach staging network; challenges and mixing of L2/L3 semantics. Potential problems of supporting staging networks, alternatives like MAC authentication bypass (MAB), and the role of WBA open roaming with Hotspot 2.0.
*   **DHCP Options in TEAP:** Securing DHCP options transport, layering concerns, remote versus local networks, integration with channel binding, registry of DHCP options and scope validation.
*   **PQC Enhancements for EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS:** Need to mandate hybrid or PQC for key exchange and authentication, certificate chain optimization, transition path considerations, and integration with TLS working group efforts.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **EAP ad hoc:** Updated draft to be submitted to the chairs, followed by shepherd write-up.
*   **EPPT:** Solicit and address feedback from the working group mailing list to move toward working group last call.
*   **EAP-AKA' and EAP-TLS:** Solicit further review and suggestions via the working group mailing list.
*   **TEAPv2:** Alan to produce updated version of the document based on meeting discussion with focus on implementability and new version number for clarity with focus on implementability.
*   **EAP Onboarding:** Hold additional discussion to determine if this is valuable work item to progress, address mixing L2/L3 semantics concerns and concerns with staging networks.

## Next Steps
*   Authors to revise drafts based on discussions.
*   Working group members to review drafts and provide feedback on mailing lists.
*   Chairs to monitor progress and schedule future discussions.
