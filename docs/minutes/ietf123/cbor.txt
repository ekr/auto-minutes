# CBOR Working Group Meeting

## Summary

The CBOR Working Group met at IETF 123, chaired by Barry Leiba and Christian Amsüss, with a third chair potentially being added. The meeting covered presentations on formal verification of CBOR implementations, evaluation of CBOR PACK compression, and discussions on three key documents: CDE (Common Deterministic Encoding), PACK, and EDN literals. The primary focus was on resolving remaining technical issues in these specifications.

## Key Discussion Points

### EverCBOR Formal Verification Presentation (Tahina, Microsoft Research)
- Presented EverCBOR, a formally verified CBOR implementation written in F* proof assistant
- Provides formal guarantees including memory safety, functional correctness, non-ambiguity, and non-malleability
- Currently supports deterministic encoding without floating point; plans to add non-deterministic CBOR and floating point support
- Discovered inaccuracies in existing CDDL descriptions, particularly missing cuts in map groups
- Generated interoperability testing with various protocols including CWT, EAT, and COSE
- Plans to submit errata for missing cuts in CDDL specifications

### CBOR PACK Evaluation (Martin)
- Presented evaluation of DNS message compression using CBOR PACK with different parameter values
- Tested various combinations of parameters A (shared reference values), B (low index straight references), and C (low index inverted references)
- Results showed minimal differences between parameter choices, with A≥8 providing best compression
- Recommended A=12, B=8, C=8 as good compromise values
- Implementation added ~300 lines of code and doubled context size

### Document Status Discussions

#### PACK Document
- Consensus on parameter values: A=12, B=8, C=8
- Need for interoperability testing with integration tags
- Technical issue identified with invalid values being replaced by tag 1100 potentially creating invalid documents when used as map keys
- Agreement to proceed with implementation work before Working Group Last Call

#### CDE (Common Deterministic Encoding) Document
- Extensive discussion on handling NaN payloads in floating point numbers
- Decision to maintain RFC 8949 approach as best available option
- Added explanatory text and code for 16-bit floating point encoding
- Disagreement on document structure and clarity of preferred serialization definitions
- Some participants argued for normative updates to RFC 8949, but show of hands indicated rough consensus against normative changes

## Decisions and Action Items

### PACK Document
- **Decision**: Adopt parameter values A=12, B=8, C=8
- **Action**: Complete interoperability testing with integration tags over next 4-6 weeks
- **Action**: Address technical issue with tag 1100 and invalid map keys

### CDE Document  
- **Action**: Tahina to submit errata for missing cuts in CDDL specifications in early August
- **Action**: Merge pull request 37 regarding NaN payload handling
- **Action**: Lawrence, Carsten, and chairs to collaborate on restructuring CDE document as applicability statement to improve clarity while maintaining RFC 8949 definitions

### EverCBOR
- **Action**: Continue testing with additional CDDL specifications from hackathon feedback
- **Action**: Add support for recursion handling with appropriate depth bounds
- **Action**: Implement non-deterministic CBOR and floating point support

## Next Steps

- Working groups will reconvene for interim call in a few weeks
- Interoperability testing period for PACK integration tags
- Collaborative editing session for CDE document restructuring
- Continued development of EverCBOR capabilities
- EDN literals discussion deferred to future meeting due to time constraints

The meeting demonstrated active engagement with formal verification approaches and continued refinement of CBOR specifications based on implementation experience and testing results.
