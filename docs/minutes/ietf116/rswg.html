<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 28 Mar 2023 00:30</p>
<h1>rswg</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The rswg meeting covered two main topics: the &quot;as implemented&quot; document for XML RFC and non-ASCII character handling in RFCs. The discussion on the &quot;as implemented&quot; document focused on migrating existing content, defining a clear plan for future changes, and addressing backwards compatibility. The non-ASCII character discussion revolved around revising RFC 7997, with a focus on simplifying rules and determining the scope of allowed characters.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;As Implemented&quot; Document:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The plan is to have a unified document for RFC 3.1 and &quot;as is&quot; with changes migrated to an appendix, allowing reconstruction of both versions.</li>
<li>Issues should be filed against the document, discussed on the mailing list, and ideally accompanied by GitHub issues.</li>
<li>The final document should clearly indicate what is &quot;as implemented&quot; and what changes are planned.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about maintaining the ability to determine the current RFC grammar during the changes.</li>
<li>There was a discussion on whether the final version will be fully backward compatible and what to do if not. A flag day with a new XML version was proposed as one potential solution.</li>
<li>Setting up CI for the draft was discussed to allow contributors to test their changes locally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Prep Tool Discussion:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Concerns were raised about the prep tool adding default values and other elements that generate noise in the document.</li>
<li>The usefulness of the table of contents being added by the prep tool was debated.</li>
<li>The x include function of the prep tool was identified as important to keep.</li>
<li>There was a discussion on whether prep tool output constitutes a policy issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Non-ASCII Character Handling (RFC 7997 Revision):</strong>
<ul>
<li>The RFC stream approval body and the Rpc now decide on the non-ASCII characters allowed in an Rf.</li>
<li>The current draft does not require marking non-ASCII characters, but allows it.</li>
<li>Carson proposed starting from base principles to create a new draft, as he believes that RFC 7997 limits acceptable characters.</li>
<li>Should the focus be on where characters are restricted? The point of Unicode should be to allow it for use by the user.</li>
<li>Including smart quotes were suggested, but was determined to not be included.</li>
<li>Several meeting participants voiced support for Paul’s document.</li>
<li>Several meeting participants voiced for developing a new document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Adopt the &quot;as implemented&quot; document as a working group document.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Adopt Paul’s Non-ASCII character doc.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> File issues against the &quot;as implemented&quot; document on GitHub and discuss them on the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Chairs will foster discussion of the principles of how existing XML should be changed on the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Create design team of how the prep tool and how it effects the publication and offer side.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Paul to extend his document on typing and math.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> List to discuss with streams on the current document.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rev the draft &quot;as implemented&quot; document based on feedback and address backward compatibility concerns.</li>
<li>Paul Hoffman and John Levine will rev the Non-ASCII document based on feedback.</li>
<li>Continue the discussion on the mailing list regarding principles for modifying existing XML.</li>
<li>Define a precise process for identifying and numbering elements.</li>
</ul>
