<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 28 Mar 2023 06:30</p>
<h1>tsvarea</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The tsvarea meeting covered the state of the transport area, followed by an invited talk by Marcus Ay on the work of the IP Performance Measurement (IPPM) working group. Discussions included the chartering of a new Congestion Control (CC) working group, the role of the Transport Area Review Team (TART), and ongoing activities within IPPM related to network telemetry and end-user experience measurements.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>State of the Area:</strong> Updates were provided on various working groups, including PSG, MASK, BTTNG, IPS, NVO3, QUIC, TAPS, and the upcoming Congestion Control (CC) working group (formerly Cash Control).</li>
<li><strong>Congestion Control Working Group:</strong> The name for the new working group was discussed. While &quot;Coco&quot; was suggested, the chairs opted for &quot;CCG&quot; to parallel &quot;ICCC.&quot;  The discussion about getting cc@ietf.org alias was brought up.</li>
<li><strong>Transport Area Review Team (TART):</strong> A call for more reviewers for TART was made, highlighting its importance in ensuring that IETF documents with transport implications are thoroughly reviewed.</li>
<li><strong>IPPM Overview (Invited Talk):</strong> Marcus Ay provided a comprehensive overview of IPPM's activities, focusing on metrics, methods, and protocols for network performance measurement.  This includes active, passive, and hybrid measurement techniques.</li>
<li><strong>IPPM Focus Areas:</strong>  IPPM is working on both network telemetry within limited domains (e.g., operators) and protocols for measuring network paths between any two hosts.</li>
<li><strong>I-OAM:</strong>  Discussion focused on the active work in IPPM on I-OAM (In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) for network telemetry, including the specification of data fields, deployment scenarios, and YANG models.</li>
<li><strong>Responsiveness Under Working Conditions:</strong> Another focus is on methods and metrics targeting end users to highlight responsiveness degradation due to bufferbloat, using TCP, TLS, and HTTP/2.</li>
<li><strong>IP Capacity Measurement:</strong> IPPM is defining protocols to measure network capacity using UDP, providing data relevant to working latency.</li>
<li><strong>Link to other areas:</strong> IPPM has strong connection with the metrics being done in It and now also Bb area with Quality of Experience metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Tools and Implementations:</strong> Discussion regarding making a collection of links to available tools and implementations visible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>CCG Charter:</strong> The charter for the Congestion Control (CC) working group will be rewritten and resubmitted to the IESG.</li>
<li><strong>IPPM Tools Visibility:</strong> IPPM chairs to consider how to create a common space/collection to share tools and implementations related to IPPM work, particularly for active measurement protocols.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue charter discussions for CCG.</li>
<li>IPPM chairs to further investigate options for making tools and implementations more visible to the community.</li>
<li>Continue ongoing work on IPPM metrics, methods, and protocols.</li>
</ul>
