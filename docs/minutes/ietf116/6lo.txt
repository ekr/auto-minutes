# 6lo

## Summary

The 6lo working group meeting covered several topics, including updates on working group document status, presentations on six low use cases, path-aware semantic addressing (PAS), reliability considerations for PAS, and transmission of compressed packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Key discussions revolved around simplifying header formats, address configuration, and reliability considerations for PAS, as well as various approaches for header compression in 802.15.4 networks.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Six Low Use Cases Draft:** Discussed minor comments from area directors and recent updates to the draft, aiming for publication in the RFC editor queue.
*   **Path-Aware Semantic Addressing (PAS):**
    *   Simplified routing header format and address configuration.
    *   Discussion on the use of extended address session option bits for PAS address acquisition. Concern raised that these bits may conflict with other drafts and more explicitly defining host and forward roles.
    *   Security section is currently empty and requires work.
    *   Multicast handling needs to be addressed.
*   **Reliability Considerations for PAS:**
    *   Explored two alternative solutions: multi-address domain and single addressing space with local storage of alternative paths.
    *   Discussion on whether reliability should be an optional feature and the usage of multiple addresses by applications.
    *   Clarity of the document needs improvement.
*   **Transmission of Compressed Packets over 802.15.4:**
    *   Presented new approaches, including pointer-based routing and a transition protocol stack to facilitate the introduction of chic compression.
    *   Discussed the potential to omit UDP checksums when using chic compression, but concerns raised that this may conflict with making security optional.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Six Low Use Cases Draft:** Proceed to RFC editor queue with dash sixteen version.
*   **Path-Aware Semantic Addressing (PAS):**
    *   Consider increasing address session option bits to two bits to more explicitly define host and forward roles.
    *   Address the security section and provide a security analysis.
    *   Address Multicast considerations for the document
    *   Align the examples in the draft.
*   **Reliability Considerations for PAS:**
    *   Refine the wording for clarity.
    *   Address alignment of examples.
*   **Transmission of Compressed Packets over 802.15.4:**
    *   Continue to discuss the implications of optional security and omitting UDP checksums.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list.
*   Address action items and refine drafts for future revisions.
*   Next meeting in San Francisco.
