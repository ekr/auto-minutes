## Summary

The gaia session focused on global internet access and featured presentations on open data standards for fiber optic networks, a full-stack management platform for internet exchanges, and a cyber public health approach to internet ecosystem resilience. A key discussion point was the development and adoption of open standards and collaborative approaches to improve internet infrastructure and access worldwide. The session also touched on potential future work for the gaia working group, including updating the existing RFP and contributing to an open-source networking book.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Open Fiber Data Standard (Steve Song, Mozilla):**
    *   The need for a structured approach to mapping and sharing fiber optic network data.
    *   Benefits of open data, including smarter investments, improved coordination, and accurate benchmarking.
    *   The importance of data standardization for identifying and addressing issues like fiber cuts and infrastructure duplication.
    *   Efforts to work with regulatory and operator associations to promote adoption of the standard.
*   **Full-Stack Management for Internet Exchanges (Mark, Tokyo University):**
    *   Minimizing the cost and effort for operators to operate internet exchanges.
    *   Automating the design, verification, and deployment of switching fabric.
    *   Using existing tools (e.g., Isp manager) and adding new modules for verification and deployment.
    *   Importance of a single web interface to manage different phases of internet exchange operation.
*   **Cyber Public Health Approach (Yuri, Cyber Green Institute):**
    *   Applying a public health model to address cybersecurity issues and promote internet ecosystem resilience.
    *   Collecting and analyzing data on a massive scale to create preventative approaches to shared risks.
    *   The need for public-private partnerships and international collaboration.
    *   Developing vital statistics for security, including measuring populations and defining analogs to mobility and mortality.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Gaia RFP Update:** A group will be formed to update the existing gaia RFP, focusing on terminology, technologies, and best practices in remote and frontier networks. Specific areas of focus include LTE, space networks, and P's. (Action: Curtis and Jane will lead the formation of this group.)
*   **Chapter Contribution:** Consider adding a chapter to the systems approach open source networking book focused on educational components. (Action: Jane and Curtis to spearhead outreach to experts to help write the new chapter)

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the gaia mailing list, focusing on technical topics.
*   Hold further discussions at the IETF meeting in San Francisco to formalize a team and begin work on the RFP update.
*   Encourage those doing good operational work to share and provide input.
