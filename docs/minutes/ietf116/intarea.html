<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 28 Mar 2023 08:00</p>
<h1>intarea</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The intarea working group meeting discussed four main topics: a liaison letter from IEEE 802, the draft &quot;intarea, Rf c seventy, forty two biz aya considerations and protocol. Documentation usage. For I eight zero two. Parameters&quot;, Ip addressing with references, and a service-aware networking framework. A new draft regarding trusted domains for SRv6 was also announced.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Liaison Letter from IEEE 802:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The letter provided comments on a draft related to 802.1 standards and requested that references to IEEE 802 standards be definitive.</li>
<li>Discrepancies between the public ether type lists managed by IEEE and IANA were discussed, and coordination efforts to synchronize these lists were highlighted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>RFC 7042 bis (AYA Considerations):</strong>
<ul>
<li>A draft version of RFC 7042 bis was presented, incorporating suggestions from IEEE 802.</li>
<li>Discussions included the process for applying for ether types, vendor-specific terminology, and clarifications on informative vs. authoritative references.</li>
<li>A problematic change requested by IEEE 802 related to the specification of local MAC addresses assigned via protocols was discussed. The group needs to resolve this issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IP Addressing with References:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A draft proposing a method for using references in IP addresses for private networks to facilitate peer-to-peer communication without address duplication was presented.</li>
<li>The proposal involved a combination of standard network addresses and locally assigned opaque references.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised regarding the security implications of publishing private IP addresses in DNS and the lack of negotiation. The presenter tried to address that the solution wasn't negotiated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Service-Aware Networking Framework:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A framework for service-aware networking was presented, focusing on identifying services at the network layer.</li>
<li>The framework aimed to adapt the network to be aware of computing resources and service requirements, especially in cloud and edge computing scenarios.</li>
<li>Differences between the proposed framework and other efforts like &quot;Intent Definition at (ID)&quot; were briefly discussed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Trusted Domains for SRv6 (Announcement):</strong>
<ul>
<li>A new draft on trusted domains for SRv6 was announced, with a request for community review and feedback. The draft aims to enhance the security around SRv6.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>RFC 7042 bis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Donald will create a new draft version of RFC 7042 bis, incorporating non-controversial changes suggested by IEEE 802.</li>
<li>The chairs will draft a liaison response to IEEE 802, clarifying the group's position on the problematic change related to local MAC address assignment.</li>
<li>The new version will be sent to IEEE 802 for review, while simultaneously initiating a working group last call with a longer-than-usual duration.</li>
<li>The group will wait to hear from IEEE 802 on the problematic parts before moving forward.</li>
<li>The IETF coordination mailing list should be notified of these steps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Donald to prepare RFC 7042 bis draft version 2.</li>
<li>Intarea chairs to draft and send a liaison letter to IEEE 802.</li>
<li>Initiate Working Group Last Call for RFC 7042 bis after draft is published.</li>
<li>Take questions and feedback about &quot;IP Addressing with References&quot; and &quot;Service-Aware Networking Framework&quot; to the mailing list for further discussion.</li>
<li>Review and provide feedback on the &quot;Trusted Domains for SRv6&quot; draft.</li>
</ul>
