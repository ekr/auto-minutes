# vcon

## Summary

This meeting was a BoF (Birds of a Feather) session to discuss the proposal for a new IETF working group focused on "conversational data" (vcon). The session covered the background of the vcon proposal, presented use cases, and discussed the proposed charter. The primary goal was to determine if there is sufficient interest and a clear problem definition to form a new working group. The session included discussions about scope, privacy, and the roles of various parties involved.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Problem Definition:** Connecting disparate levels of the network stack, data silos, and potential interest from other SDOs (Standards Development Organizations).
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Personal data privacy and customer data protection in automotive supply chains.
    *   Integration of conversations and analysis services (AI, machine learning).
    *   Sharing message history across multiple clients for the same user.
*   **Charter Scope:**
    *   Defining a container format for conversational content.
    *   Specifying mechanisms for integrity and privacy.
    *   Identifying missing media types (e.g., time-labeled transcripts).
    *   Excluding algorithms for transcript analysis, real-time streaming, transport, and database storage.
*   **Privacy Concerns:**  The definition of "privacy" in the context of vcon was discussed at length. The need to distinguish between internal privacy management and interoperable privacy mechanisms was raised. Discussion on data minimization, redaction, and ensuring a verifiable chain of custody for data.
*   **Auditing and Logging:** The potential for vcon to facilitate auditing and logging of data processing activities was explored.
*   **Workforce Optimization (WFO) Use Case:** Supporting WFO scenarios, particularly quality management, requires including more information about the agent and call details.
*   **Minimal Viable Product:**  The need to identify a minimal, practical use case that could be implemented with a limited set of features was highlighted.
*   **Interoperability:** A key goal is to enable interoperability between different vendors and systems.
*   **Related Work:** The relationship between vcon and other existing data exchange formats and standards was questioned.
*   **Technical Feasibility:** The ability to encrypt individual objects within a vcon container with different keys to control access.
*   **Engagement:** Discussion regarding the people involved in building and using the specifications.
*   **Consent and Data Protection:**  Inclusion of tracking consent of participants as attachments.
*   **Use Case Document:** Suggestion to deliver a use case Internet Draft that is helpful for understanding the scope of the project and can be used by the working group.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** The vcon proponents will revise the proposed charter based on the feedback received during the BoF session. This includes:
    *   Clarifying the definition of "privacy" or replacing it with more specific terms like "confidentiality" or "audit log."
    *   Incorporating the Workforce Optimization use case and related agent/call details.
    *   Adding language to address object-level encryption.
    *   Including the concerns about identity and PII derivatives.
    *   Investigating related work.
*   **Decision:** Create a deliverable for the working group to produce a use case Internet Draft that is helpful for understanding the scope of the project.
*   **Action Item:** Interested parties were asked to contribute to the discussion on the mailing list and provide feedback on the revised charter text.
*   **Action Item:** Those interested in contributing text to vcon documents are to send an email to V con-chairs at I t f dot org.

## Next Steps

*   The vcon proponents will circulate the revised charter on the mailing list.
*   The IETF community will review the revised charter and provide feedback.
*   Further discussion will take place on the mailing list to refine the scope and goals of the proposed working group.
*   A decision will be made by the area directors on whether to charter a vcon working group based on the revised charter and community feedback.
