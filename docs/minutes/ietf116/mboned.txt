## Summary
The mboned working group meeting covered the status of working group documents, a presentation on the MT Yang model, a demo and discussion of the Group Address Allocation Protocol (GAP), a presentation on enhancements to LISP multicast, and a discussion of Tree-based CDN (3DN) for live streaming. Several action items and requests for further review were identified.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Telemetry Draft:**  Working group last call is ending this week but has received no support from non-authors. Encouragement was given to review and comment.
*   **Game Models Draft & Redundant Ingress Failover Draft:** Updates requested and plans to re-initiate working group last call.
*   **Jake's Multitask to Browser Documents:** Jake has been reassigned.  Seeking new owner for these expired drafts.
*   **MT Yang Model:** Request for working group adoption following presentation and discussion.
*   **Group Address Allocation Protocol (GAP):**  Presentation and demo of a new decentralized group address allocation protocol. Discussion revolved around address family handling, uniqueness, collision detection, and security.
*   **Enhancements to LISP Multicast:** Presentation on enhancements to LISP multicast for scaling and mixed-mode operation. Discussion included potential for native forwarding and the need for a bit in the RoE entry to indicate this.
*   **Tree-based CDN (3DN):** Presentation on leveraging native multicast and overlay technologies for live streaming. Feedback was requested on transport-related issues, including TCP vs. UDP, packet loss, encryption, authorization, and ABR.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Telemetry Draft:**  Encourage more feedback and support for advancement on the mailing list.
*   **Game Models Draft & Redundant Ingress Failover Draft:** Update document and initiate new working group last call.
*   **Jake's Multitask to Browser Documents:**  Solicit volunteers to take over the drafts on the mailing list.
*   **MT Yang Model:**  Start an adoption call on the mailing list.
*   **GAP:**
    *   Dino to add text to the spec to define uniqueness of address allocations, and the address families supported.
    *   Dino to change link local scope to global scope for IPv6 addresses in the spec.
    *   Dino to update the specification to indicate that two messages should be sent in case of mixed IPV4 and IPV6 deployments.
*   **Enhancements to LISP Multicast:**
    *   Sad to look into incorporating native forwarding to the RoE entry.
*   **3DN:**
    * Ping the MeEcho team to potentially use 3DN for IETF meetings.

## Next Steps

*   Take MT Yang model adoption to the mailing list.
*   Further testing, corner case identification, and security feature development for GAP.
*   Incorporate feedback into LISP multicast draft.
*   Encourage review and feedback on the 3DN draft in the mailing list.
