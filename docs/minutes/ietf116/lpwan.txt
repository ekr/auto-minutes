## Summary

The LPWAN working group held a joint session with the CHC working group. Discussions covered the transition of documents from LPWAN to CHC, new work on CHC streaming mode, proposals for updating RFC 8724, and access control for CHC rules. Key topics included the adoption of CHC technology, the need for security considerations, and potential implementation challenges.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **LPWAN to CHC Transition:** Discussion on moving LPWAN documents to CHC, with a proposal to resubmit documents as "draft-chc" instead of "draft-lpwan". The CHC charter includes maintaining LPWAN documents.
*   **CHC Streaming Mode:** Sergio presented a new CHC streaming mode for continuous data streams, using window and tag cycles for reliable data transfer. Discussions revolved around the necessity of both window and tag cycles.
*   **CHC Instance Initiation:** Proposal for a new "CHC Instance Init" message to facilitate rule exchange at the start of a CHC session. Alternative options, such as modifying the first fragment in aqua mode, were also discussed.
*   **RFC 8724 Update:** Marco presented proposals for updating RFC 8724 on using CHC for CoAP, covering clarifications on option handling, payload markers, and proxy deployments. The update aims to align the RFC with current developments.
*   **Access Control for CHC Rules:** Discussion on access control for CHC rules, including the ability to modify existing rules, add new elements, or add/remove rules. Security implications of rule modifications were emphasized.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Resubmit LPWAN Documents as CHC:** Authors of LPWAN documents should resubmit them as "draft-chc-XX".
*   **Evaluate CHC Streaming Mode:** Further evaluation of the necessity of both window and tag cycles in the CHC streaming mode proposal.
*   **Interim Meeting for RFC 8724 and Access Control:** An interim meeting will be scheduled to further discuss the RFC 8724 update and access control for CHC rules.
*   **Security Considerations for Rule Modification:** A detailed analysis of the security implications of modifying CHC rules is required.

## Next Steps

*   Schedule an interim meeting to address outstanding issues related to RFC 8724 and access control.
*   Further develop the access control framework, incorporating security considerations and addressing potential attack vectors.
*   Prepare revised drafts of the CHC streaming mode and access control documents based on meeting feedback.
