<h1>roll</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This meeting covered the current status of several active Internet-Drafts within the ROLL working group. Discussions included updates on O-Ripple, Downward Projection, Neighbor Solicitation Extension, Fast Proactive Route Loss Detection, and Mode of Operation Extension. Decisions were made regarding next steps for several drafts, including moving some forward for working group last call and scheduling others for further discussion in interim meetings.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>O-Ripple:</strong> Charlie provided an update. Version 16 addressed readability and protocol clarifications.  A new version 17 is expected soon, addressing comments from Tony's Routing Directorate review. The key point is to clarify the association between route replies and requests when instance IDs differ.</li>
<li><strong>Downward Projection:</strong> Pascal presented the updates. Routing Directorate review is pending, expected in 2-3 weeks. No open issues currently.</li>
<li><strong>Neighbor Solicitation Extension:</strong> Draft was returned to the working group. Ari is committed to working on it, with assistance from Georgia and Pascal. The extension allows nodes to select alternate parents based on neighbor information. A key question from review concerned the use case beyond packet replication and elimination.</li>
<li><strong>Fast Proactive Route Loss Detection:</strong> Conrad (absent) initiated this draft. Aim is to detect route loss quickly. A response to interim questions in October was not fully addressed. Questions addressed the scenario where sentinel nodes lose connectivity to each other or to the root. Pascal asked if querying the root directly might be a better approach. It was decided to revisit this topic in the next interim meeting to understand how the draft facilitates hot standby route switching.</li>
<li><strong>Mode of Operation Extension:</strong> This short document defines the value 7 for extended mode of operation. The document is considered ready for working group last call, pending Routing Directorate and security reviews.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>O-Ripple:</strong> Charlie to release version 17 soon, incorporating Routing Directorate review feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Downward Projection:</strong> Submit to the IESG after Routing Directorate review is complete.</li>
<li><strong>Neighbor Solicitation Extension:</strong> Ari to address review comments before working group last call.</li>
<li><strong>Fast Proactive Route Loss Detection:</strong> Add the draft to the agenda for the next interim meeting to discuss implications for hot standby scenarios and whether the current proposal is sufficient for achieving the required functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Mode of Operation Extension:</strong> Proceed with Routing Directorate and security reviews, and shepherd the document in preparation for submission to the IESG.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Schedule an interim meeting to discuss Fast Proactive Route Loss Detection.</li>
<li>Continue work on resolving review comments for drafts being prepared for working group last call.</li>
<li>Await Routing Directorate reviews for Downward Projection and Mode of Operation Extension.</li>
</ul>
