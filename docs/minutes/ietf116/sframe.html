<h1>sframe</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This sframe working group meeting focused on resolving open issues on the sframe draft to enable a working group last call. The meeting involved a detailed review of open GitHub issues, discussing potential resolutions, and assigning action items to the editors. Key topics included stream definitions, key management, replay protection, Rt integration, and metadata handling.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue #100: Stream Definition:</strong> Debate on whether to include a stream definition in the document. The consensus leaned toward not defining a new stream construct within sframe itself, but requiring applications to specify key usage context.</li>
<li><strong>Key Management:</strong> Discussion about specifying application requirements for key management, including key rotation and security properties.</li>
<li><strong>Issue #97: Out of Scope Key Management:</strong> Clarifying the boundaries of key management responsibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Issue #96: Rt Specifics:</strong> Agreement to audit the document and ensure Rt mentions are primarily examples, maintaining the document's generality. Testing implementation over webrtc data channel.</li>
<li><strong>Overhead Analysis (PR):</strong> A pull request redoing overhead analysis was flagged for review.</li>
<li><strong>Issue #76: Replay Protection:</strong>  Extensive discussion on replay protection, considering scope, potential timing oracles, and transport layer protections.  A proposal emerged to note the security trade-offs and allow applications to implement replay windows (timer-based or counter-based) if needed, without mandating a specific mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Issue #70: Adoption Call Feedback:</strong> Identified as needing individual issue breakouts.</li>
<li><strong>Issue #17: Authenticated Metadata:</strong>  Debate on the necessity of an authenticated metadata field. There were concerns about potential misuse and the need for application-level agreement on metadata content. There was a resolution keep the field but provide warnings in the spec text.</li>
<li><strong>Issue #3: Var Structure:</strong> Consideration of using quick varints. This was rejected.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issue #100 (Stream Definition):</strong> Editors to clarify application requirements for key usage. Action: Richard, Sergio</li>
<li><strong>Issue #97 (Out of Scope Key Management):</strong> Document security properties achieved with specific key rotation practices. Action: Richard, Sergio</li>
<li><strong>Issue #96 (Rt Specifics):</strong> Audit and remove non-essential Rt references. Editors also encouraged to test the code with webrtc data channels and to keep two flavors of implementation. Action: Richard, Sergio</li>
<li><strong>Overhead Analysis (PR):</strong> Review and provide feedback on the pull request. Action: Justin (reminder needed)</li>
<li><strong>Issue #76 (Replay Protection):</strong>  Editors to document the security trade-offs and allow applications to implement replay windows (timer-based or counter-based) if needed, without mandating a specific mechanism. Action: Richard, Sergio</li>
<li><strong>Issue #70 (Adoption Call Feedback):</strong> Break out into individual issues. Action: TBD (assigned to in absentia)</li>
<li><strong>Issue #17 (Authenticated Metadata):</strong> Keep the authenticated metadata feature, add text describing what the application has to do, and confirm necessity during WG Last Call. Action: Richard, Sergio, Yu</li>
<li><strong>Issue #3 (Var Structure):</strong> Close the issue. Action: Richard, Sergio</li>
<li><strong>Key Retry:</strong> It has to have a retry mechanism, it has to clear signal of retry. It also can not be marked as a replay. Action: Richard, Sergio</li>
<li><strong>Key Structure Leakage:</strong> Document the leakage of the sections, if application is concerned then they can use another approach. Action: Martin</li>
<li><strong>Editors:</strong> Richard, Sergio</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>The editors will address the action items and prepare a revised draft.</li>
<li>A virtual interim meeting will be scheduled in about a month, with a poll for times. The meeting will be canceled if the editors provide a satisfactory draft before then.</li>
<li>Continue to nail the punch list the application has to fill out</li>
</ul>
