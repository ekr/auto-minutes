## Summary

This meeting of the routing area focused on updates from the LSR, IDR, and BEST working groups. Key discussions included the work on YANG models, BGP extensions for colored routes, and considerations for IP policy within the IETF. Jeff Haas also provided valuable insights into lessons learned while developing the Epic BGP YANG module.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **LSR Working Group Update:** Focus on base protocol extensions, protocol maintenance, segment routing, flex algorithm, and YANG models for IS-IS and OSPF. Interactions with IDR, BEER, SPRING, and PC B mp were highlighted.
*   **IDR Working Group Update:** Discussed the painful Wiki migration, BGP routes with color (class transport and color routing proposals), the BGP YANG model nearing completion, handling BGP peers that are blackholed, and potential dismissal of features related to confederations. Also addressed BGP enabled services and inconsistencies in route selection.
*   **BEST Working Group Update:** Focused on VPN, improving the base specification of E-VPN, new options in terms of new types of service interfaces, interaction between Layer 3 VPN and E-VPN, additional load balancing multi solutions, and multi extensions options.
*   **Epic BGP YANG Module Lessons:** Jeff Haas presented lessons learned from working on the BGP YANG module, covering topics such as populating initial contents, feature management, maintainability, type management, and collaboration using GitHub. Emphasis was given on testing, examples and interoperability.
*   **IP Policy Review:** A quick review of high points from Bc seventy nine, with particular emphasis on the role of working groups with respect to talking about and considering licensing terms. Discussed section seven of the document regarding Ip r, and emphasized that working groups should not hold forth on underlying patents that have been disclosed.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IDR:** Progress both class transport and color routing proposals as experimental due to lack of consensus.
*   **IDR:** Continue discussion about loosening controls on certain features among "consenting adults."
*   **IDR:** Further discussion needed about splitting off A side work into a new working group or other appropriate forum.
*   **Routing Area:** To address route targets, route origins and other identifiers that were not implemented as IANA maintained elements in previous RFCs, the Routing Area should consider to delegate those to IANA.

## Next Steps

*   **IDR:** Hold an overflow meeting on the 24th to continue discussions.
*   **IDR:** Reviewers needed for the BGP YANG module.
*   **Routing Area:** Individual participants to review Bc seventy nine.
