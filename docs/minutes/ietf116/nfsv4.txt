# nfsv4

## Summary
The nfsv4 IETF meeting covered several topics, including the status of various drafts, working group adoption polls, and discussions on internationalization and security. Key areas of focus were the use of sc layout with MD, RDMA extensions, internationalization challenges, layout delegation state IDs, and error reporting via layout return. New proposals for handling out-of-sequence requests were also discussed.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **sc layout with MD:** The draft is nearing working group last call.  A decision was made to rename the draft to "NFS Protocol Extensions for Storage Devices". Conversion to a newer base format (version 2 or markdown) will occur.
*   **RDMA Extensions:** There was a proposal to consider working group adoption. The discussion covered the scope, relevance of informative content, and potential for integration with nfsv4 via RPC over RDMA. A poll indicated positive support for adoption.
*   **Internationalization:** Significant discussion regarding the complexities of internationalization in nfsv4, especially concerning case sensitivity and normalization.  Challenges stem from underlying file system limitations and discrepancies between theoretical specifications and real-world server implementations. It was decided to solicit a review from the IESG's internationalization team.
*   **R c fifty six sixty one bi and Related Documents:** Concerns were raised about the expired draft document, the group will work to address and resubmit the document. 
*   **Layout Delegation State Ids:**  Status update and a solid push towards last call. Reviews have been given and the group will take it to the mailing list to check for objections.
*   **Reporting of Errors via Layout Return:** A draft allows clients to report back to the server why it hasn't done a file recovery.  The discussion covered whether the functionality applies to all layout types. A poll indicated support for working group adoption.
*   **Layout Week Cash Consistency:** Discussion after a refresh of the document. The group decided to do a last call on the list after a few more reviews.
*   **Rpc TLS Implementation Status:** Status update on Rpc tls implementation across different clients.
*   **Sequence Id Calibration:** Proposal for new operations to handle out-of-sequence requests (Sequence Query and C Sequence Query).  Concerns were raised about the root cause of the issue and the need for new opcodes. It was also pointed out that current extensions to for dot two already have operations in this slot.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **sc layout with MD:**
    *   **Decision:** Rename draft to "NFS Protocol Extensions for Storage Devices."
    *   **Action Item:** Update draft with new name and base format (version 2 or Markdown).
*   **RDMA Extensions:**
    *   **Decision:** Move forward with working group adoption.
    *   **Action Item:** Split the document to remove the informative part before bringing it to the working group.
*   **Internationalization:**
    *   **Action Item:**  Dave Black will work to find the appropriate IESG reviewer with Lars Eggert's help.
    *   **Action Item:** Chris will do a review of the current document. 
*   **Last call for layout Delegation:**
    *   **Action Item:** Take it to the mailing list and check for further objections.
*   **Take the Security Document to the weekly meetings.**
*   **Reporting of Errors via Layout Return:**
    *   **Action Item:** Review if the draft applies to all layout types.
*   **Layout Week Cash Consistency:**
    *   **Action Item:** Get more reviews before calling it a last call.
*   **Sequence Id Calibration:**
    *   **Action Item:** Revisit the decision if the op codes will affect any extensions to for dot two.

## Next Steps
*   Post the RDMA Extensions working group adoption to the mailing list for confirmation.
*   Further discussion on internationalization will occur on the mailing list, with efforts to find an IESG reviewer.
*   Address the expired draft document and resubmit it with corrections.
*   The P has security benefit will be discussed in the weekly meetings.
*   Last call on Layout Delegation state ids.
*   Get more reviews for Layout week cash consistency.
