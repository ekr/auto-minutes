## Summary
The SPRING working group meeting covered several topics, including segment routing protection mechanisms, inter-domain intent-aware routing, and security considerations for SRv6 networks. Discussions focused on technical details, potential solutions, and the need for further review and feedback.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SR Fixed Path Egress Protection:**  A proposal for a fast protection mechanism for fixed path segment routing.  Feedback was solicited.
*   **SRv6 Midpoint Protection:** Discussion regarding a solution for midpoint protection in SRv6 networks, particularly in the context of IGP convergence and comparison to similar solutions for other data planes (SR-MPLS). It was suggested to merge this solution with existing midpoint protection drafts.
*   **Segment Routing Aware Channel Programming:** A new SR Nodal behavior proposal for application in layer 1 channel programming, especially for heterogeneous networks.
*   **ICMP Extensions for IP Related Information Validation:** A new ICMP extension proposal to validate IP-related information, closing the gap between control and data plane validation.
*   **SRv6 Locator Distribution via DHCP:** Discussion of a solution to distribute SRv6 locators via DHCP, intended to optimize provisioning in large-scale networks.
*   **Multi-Homed Egress Protection:**  A mechanism for faster failover in multi-homed egress scenarios by carrying backup SIDs.
*   **Security Considerations for SRv6 Networks:** Presentation and discussion of a document outlining security considerations for SRv6. There was an active discussion and requests for detailed reviews.
*   **Inter-Domain Intent-Aware Routing:**  Updates to a problem statement draft for inter-domain intent-aware routing using color. Focus was on service intent requirements and operational/OEM requirements. Working group adoption was requested.
*   **Auto Edge Protection:** An attempt to develop a mechanism to achieve fast failover times (50ms) for virtualized services with minimal configuration.
*   **SRv6 Source Address Verification:** Proposal to use SRv6 service We-Can-See as source address for tunnel endpoints.
*   **SRv6/MPLS Service Interworking:** Solution to reduce state in the interworking node, presented as option C and uses existing vendor capability in silicon.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **SRv6 Midpoint Protection:** Authors to consider merging their draft with existing SR-MPLS midpoint protection drafts to create a unified solution.
*   **All Drafts:** Participants encouraged to review the presented drafts and provide feedback to the authors, especially on the mailing lists.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to incorporate feedback received during the meeting into their drafts.
*   Working group members to review and comment on the drafts.
*   Consider the security considerations document for working group adoption.
