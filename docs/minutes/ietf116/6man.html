<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 29 Mar 2023 00:30</p>
<h1>6man</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The 6man meeting covered several important topics, including updates on existing drafts, discussions on new proposals, and announcements regarding related work. Key discussions revolved around the V-ID option, stateless address autoconfiguration, limiting extension headers, hop-by-hop processing, and generalized IPv6 tunnels. There were also lively debates on the complexity and practicality of proposed solutions.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>V-ID Option:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Clarification on the relationship between V-ID and network slicing was sought.</li>
<li>The intended use cases and drivers were discussed, distinguishing between operational markers and application needs.</li>
<li>The performance impact of adding additional headers was raised, with a request for statistics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Improving the Robustness of Stateless Address Autoconfiguration:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Concerns were raised regarding the complexity of the active avoidance algorithm and its impact on existing implementations.</li>
<li>The need to balance the complexity of multi-prefix/multi-router scenarios with simpler single-router cases was highlighted.</li>
<li>The impact of packet loss on mobile devices and the lifetimes for prefixes were also questioned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Limiting Extension Headers:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The need for a routing area review was noted.</li>
<li>The default number of non-padding options, padding options, and the IPv6 header chain length were discussed.</li>
<li>Empirical data on the real-world behavior of devices when large extension headers are used was suggested.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hop-by-Hop Processing Procedures:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The importance of defining &quot;full forwarding rate&quot; and addressing potential reordering issues were discussed.</li>
<li>Considerations for the size of options and the number of hop-by-hop options were raised.</li>
<li>The use of terminology concerning nodes versus routers was discussed to make sure the proper devices were addressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Proposed DHCPv6 Options:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A new flag within router advertisements was proposed to allow DHCPv6 for prefix delegation to handle situations with multiple interfaces.</li>
<li>The DHCPv6 options allow scaling of IPv6 address space for VMs.</li>
<li>Concerns about legacy support were raised.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Generalized IPv6 Tunnels:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A side meeting on generalized IPv6 tunnels (G-IPv6) was summarized.</li>
<li>Key questions discussed included the relationship between G-IPv6 and existing tunnels, extending existing IPv6 tunnels, and whether G-IPv6 is necessary for campus and data center networks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stateless Address Autoconfiguration:</strong> Continue discussion on the mailing list due to time constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Limiting Extension Headers:</strong> Request a routing area review.</li>
<li><strong>Hop-by-Hop Processing Procedures:</strong> Revise the draft based on comments and then ask for a working group last call.</li>
<li><strong>New Proposed DHCPv6 Options</strong> Submit the draft to the DHCP working group</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussions on open issues via the mailing list.</li>
<li>Incorporate feedback into revised drafts.</li>
<li>Initiate working group last calls for applicable documents.</li>
</ul>
