## Summary

The IAB Open meeting covered several topics, including IAB document updates, technical program updates, liaison updates, and a workshop recap. A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to discussing the environmental impact of the Internet, featuring presentations on energy efficiency and a recap of the recent IAB workshop on the topic. The discussion highlighted the complexity of the issue, trade-offs involved in optimizing for energy efficiency, and potential future directions for the IETF.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IAB Updates:** Updates on IAB documents in the R editor queue, recently adopted documents, and reports on recent workshops.
*   **Evolvability, Deployability, and Maintainability (EDM) Program:** Discussion of the EDM program and its related documents.
*   **Liaison Updates:** Updates on Liaison Manager appointments and activities, including the Broadband Forum (BBF) liaison.
*   **Broadband Forum (BBF) Liaison:** A detailed overview of the IETF-BBF liaison relationship, focusing on its informal and lightweight nature, confidentiality considerations, and areas of mutual interest (e.g., IP capacity metrics, YANG models, stamp).
*   **Energy Efficiency and the Internet:** Presentation on using Internet principles to improve energy efficiency in various sectors, including building management and logistics. The potential of the Internet to reduce physical transportation through digital alternatives was emphasized.
*   **IAB Workshop on Environmental Impact:** Recap of the workshop, highlighting the diverse perspectives and the broad range of factors contributing to the environmental impact of the Internet. Topics discussed include control algorithms, implementation considerations, metrics, and data formats.
*   **Trade-offs and Optimization:** Discussions about the trade-offs involved in optimizing for energy efficiency versus other performance metrics like latency and throughput.
*   **Data Formats:** Discussions around optimizing data formats for energy efficiency.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Potential IAB Program on Environmental Impact:** There was discussion about the potential of creating an IAB program focused on environmental impact and sustainability, with the goal of identifying concrete actions that the IETF can take and then handing them off to relevant working groups.

## Next Steps

*   **Further Discussion on Environmental Impact:** Continued discussion on the environmental impact of the Internet, potentially through a BOF or an IAB program.
*   **Review Workshop Materials:** Review the materials from the IAB workshop on environmental impact, including the papers and the report, and provide feedback.
*   **Consider Environment Impact Statements in Documents:** Explore the possibility of including environmental impact considerations in IETF drafts.
