<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 28 Mar 2023 06:30</p>
<h1>mpls</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The MPLS working group meeting covered five draft presentations, focusing on various topics including data key state updates, bootstrapping D-iD sessions, encapsulation of STAMP packets, using SRv6 data plane for P2MP trees, and performance measurement using native marking.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Key State Update (Version 5):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The presenter discussed updates to the draft and its intended use for testing.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised that the problem statement is already covered in RFC 8370. It was noted that the text reproduced some content from the cited RFC.</li>
<li>A suggestion was made to consider if the draft belongs in the TEAS working group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bootstrapping D-iD Sessions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The presentation focused on issues related to using LSPs to bootstrap D-iD sessions and IP/UDP encapsulation of control messages.</li>
<li>Clarifications were proposed regarding the use of the &quot;no reply&quot; flag and the behavior of the responder.</li>
<li>Clarifications were proposed regarding the use of IPv6 addressing in IP/UDP encapsulation. The group discussed using the IPv6 loopback address range.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encapsulation of STAMP Test Packets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The presenters discussed encapsulating STAMP test and reflected packets over MPLS.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about the UDP port usage (862 or dynamic range) and its potential impact on hardware filtering limitations and the slow path. The group agreed that operational challenges should be considered in standards development.</li>
<li>A question was asked about STAMP's applicability to other data plane technologies and how sessions would be bootstrapped in those cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P2MP Trees using SRv6 Data Plane:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The presentation covered using M-OAM or RCP signaling with SRv6 for P2MP trees, indicating functional bits for SRv6.</li>
<li>Discussion focused on the use case and whether SR nodes also need to support RSVP-TE, and if the added value of SR replication segment is questionable if end to end RSVP-TE is available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance Measurement with Native Marking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The presentation explained the solution for performance measurement using native marking and extension neighbor fifteen.</li>
<li>The draft utilizes the TLV structure and introduces new indicators to correlate flow id and loss/delay.</li>
<li>A question was posed regarding how the implementation identifies the flow TLV and whether a new address space is necessary. The presenter clarified that this is just an example of how the flow ID solution can be used.</li>
<li>A question from a remote participant discussed using the TC field.</li>
<li>A related draft presented how to implement it with mAM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Key State Update (Version 5):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The presenter will contact the author of the previous RFC to discuss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bootstrapping D-iD Sessions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The presenter will consider working group adoption of the draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encapsulation of STAMP Test Packets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Participants were encouraged to reach out to the presenter for further discussions on integrated OAM.</li>
<li>The presenter will consider how the protocol will be bootstrapped in other data planes besides MPLS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P2MP Trees using SRv6 Data Plane:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The draft will be separated into two drafts, one for mLDP and one for RCP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance Measurement with Native Marking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The presenters have requested a last call of the draft to the working group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to address comments and questions raised during the presentations.</li>
<li>Working group to consider adoption of the draft on Bootstrapping D-iD Sessions.</li>
<li>Working group to consider last call on &quot;Performance Measurement with Native Marking&quot;.</li>
<li>Further discussion and collaboration on integrated OAM between participants.</li>
</ul>
