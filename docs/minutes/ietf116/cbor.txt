## Summary

This meeting covered the status of existing documents and discussed proposals for new work, including profiles, a media type for diagnostic notation, time tags, DNS over CBOR, and updates to CDDL (CBOR data definition language). Several documents are proposed for adoption, and the meeting schedule was confirmed.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **CBOR Profiles:** Discussion centered around the need for profiles and how to standardize their usage, particularly regarding application-specific information and avoiding fragmentation of metadata across different fields.
*   **Diagnostic Notation Media Type:** Proposal to register a media type (application/cbor-diagnostic) for extended diagnostic notation due to its widespread use and the diminishing concern about it being misused as an interchange format.
*   **Time Tag Document:** The time tag document is nearing completion after addressing working group comments and awaits a shepherd write-up. A related document in the `s` working group on extending the date-time format is progressing.
*   **DNS over CBOR:** A draft to reduce DNS packet size in constrained networks by encoding DNS messages in CBOR. Key points included addressing feedback, clarifying fallback mechanisms, and plans for implementation and evaluation, including comparing compression algorithm efficiency.
*   **CDDL 2.0:** Discussion on several CDDL-related documents, including fixes, additions of control operators, and modular structure. Target for grammar fixes and control operators is before IETF 116.
*   **CDDL 2.5 (Annotations):** Discussed the potential for extending the processing model to include annotations for adding information to data items and enabling more advanced validation and transformation.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** Adopt the Ed literal draft. (Confirmed on the list)
*   **Decision:** Adopt the following CDDL-related drafts: update eighty six ten gram, Cd on more control and Cd modules. (Confirmed on the list)
*   **Action Item:** Post messages to the mailing list to confirm the adoption of the Ed literal draft and the CDDL-related drafts.
*   **Decision:** Next meeting will be on the nineteenth of April, and then every two weeks after that until IETF 117. (Confirmed on the list)
*   **Action Item:** Post a message to the mailing list to confirm the meeting schedule.
*   **Action Item:** Find and compare an example for the compression algorithm for DNS over CBOR, along with a comparison table between S via format sea and pe.
*   **Action Item:** Look at various proposals and extract common characteristics of them to get more focus on sea.

## Next Steps

*   Shepherd write-up for the time tag document.
*   Implement a version of DNS over CBOR and conduct an evaluation.
*   Evaluate the impact of using import and include.
*   Continue working on the adopted documents.
*   Explore the possibility of cross universe references.
