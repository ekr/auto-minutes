# dispatch

## Summary
The dispatch working group meeting covered six items, five technical and one administrative. Topics included multi-format specifications, the envelope format, a protocol for interactive low-latency media transmission, improving the Opus codec, and emergency e911 services over WiFi. A new chair was announced, and discussions revolved around the appropriate venues for standardization of the presented work.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Multi-format Specifications (Brand):** Discussion on multi-format specifications (multi-base, multi-hash), their use cases, and potential standardization paths (AD-sponsored, CFRG, or a new working group). Concerns were raised regarding the need for a magic cookie to avoid namespace collisions and the suitability of existing registries.
*   **Envelope Format (Wolf Mc.):** Presentation of the "envelope" format for structured data, built on CBOR. Discussion on whether the related "Dc board" profile for CBOR should be dispatched to the CBOR working group. Concerns were raised about the generality of the envelope format and the lack of specific use cases.
*   **Interactive Media Transmission Protocol (Duck Pay):** Proposal for a protocol enabling interactive low-latency media transmission. The discussion focused on whether this work falls within the scope of the MARK working group. Concerns were raised about the lack of demonstrated need for an abstraction layer above existing transmission protocols.
*   **Improving Opus Codec (Jean marc Vale):** Proposal to improve the Opus codec using deep learning techniques while maintaining compatibility. A strong consensus emerged in favor of creating a new working group for this effort, potentially with a broader scope to consider new codecs and standardization of ML models.
*   **Emergency E911 over WiFi (S):** Presentation of a proposal for enabling emergency e911 calls over WiFi, leveraging open roaming. The discussion focused on location signaling and the need to engage with the IETF's emergency services working group (E911).

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Multi-format Specifications:**  The chairs will take the discussion offline with the author to determine whether to pursue an I-D with the appropriate area director for registry or a new, small working group, depending on the level of desired change control.  A summary will be posted to the list.
*   **Envelope Format:** The "Dc board" profile will be dispatched to the CBOR working group. The chairs will work with the authors of the "envelope" format offline to better define use cases and determine a suitable path forward.
*   **Interactive Media Transmission Protocol:** No action will be taken at this time, but the author will be encouraged to discuss the proposal with the MARK working group.
*   **Improving Opus Codec:** A new working group will be formed to explore improvements to the Opus codec and standardize ML models. The author will work with the area director on a charter.
*   **Emergency E911 over WiFi:** The authors will be encouraged to engage with the E911 working group and clarify which aspects of the proposal require standardization.

## Next Steps
*   Chairs to post a summary of the meeting outcomes to the mailing list.
*   Authors of each draft to engage with the suggested working groups or individuals to refine their proposals and determine appropriate next steps.
*   Formation of a new working group focused on improving audio codecs using machine learning techniques.
