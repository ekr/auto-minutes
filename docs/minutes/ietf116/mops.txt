## Summary

The mops session covered several important topics related to media over QUIC and other transport protocols, including updates on existing drafts, presentations on hologram technology, and an overview of the work being done in the IETF's Mu working group. Discussions focused on the challenges of delivering high-quality, low-latency video and AR/VR experiences, the trade-offs between reliability and efficiency in network transport, and the need for new approaches to media distribution.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **XR Traffic Characteristics:** Discussion on Xr workload characteristics that can be expected by network operators and related operational consequences.
*   **Performance Metrics for XR:**  Discussion on Performance metrics that are acceptable to the user and operational strategies that can be adopted.
*   **Treaty (Network-Based Replication):** Review of Treaty and its use of native multicast combined with overlays to deliver multicast services. Discussion around deployment and advantages as compared to CDNs
*   **Encryption and Privacy for multicast:** Questions about how an architecture supports encryption and/or privacy.
*   **Adaptive Bitrates and Congestion Control:** Discussion of ABMR solutions when using multicast and no longer TCP.
*   **Hologram and Ar/Vr Delivery:** Overview of hologram delivery systems, including the challenges of latency, various media types (texture maps, point clouds, light fields), and the need for new approaches to content distribution.
*   **Mock Working Group Update:** Brief on the ongoing activities in the mock working group and key discussion points around scenarios and requirements.
*   **Dns usage:** Discussions on usage of DNS for video delivery.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Rin and Rita draft update:** Rin and Rita to update their draft based on the feedback received and then the chairs will initiate a working group last call.
*   **Treaty:** Lenny and team to add basic diagrams, additional details on gaps in the draft, and call for future work.
*   **Encourage Mock Participation:** Attendees were encouraged to review drafts and participate in mock discussions and the current adotion call.
## Next Steps

*   Rin and Rita to publish updated draft
*   Lenny to update Treaty draft based on WG feedback
*   WG to provide feedback on Mock requirements and scenarios drafts
