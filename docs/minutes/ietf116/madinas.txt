## Summary
The meeting covered status updates from the chairs, discussed the use cases and problem statement document, the market on the optimization state of affairs document, and spent a significant portion of the meeting on the Bc handling Rc discussion, including next steps. Status updates were also provided from I and WPA, including a demonstration of open roaming and discussion of next steps.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Use Cases and Problem Statement Document (Jerome):**
    *   The document is considered fairly stable, though section 7 containing possible solutions to Rc is intended to be removed once a Bc document exists.
    *   Jerome and Emilia have started extracting section 7 into a skeleton for a Bc.
*   **Market Normalization State of Affairs Document (Carlos):**
    *   Updates include a new policy, the "session meeting mac".
    *   The title of the document is still under discussion whether to include "state of affairs" or not.
    *   The document is potentially ready for working group last call, pending reviews.
*   **Bc Handling Rc Discussion:**
    *   Two proposals to start work on the Bc have emerged, one from Michael and another from Jerome and Emilia.
    *   Michael expressed concerns about "poor hacks" maintaining the status quo and advocated for "real identities."
    *   Discussion included the challenges of creating a persistent identifier without recreating the original privacy problems.
    *   Alan D. noted existing work in Nancy, but progress is slow due to the need for input from both the IETF and the IEEE.
    *   Dan Har expressed concerns about "hacks" that don't address real issues.
*   **I (IEEE 802.11) Status Update (Jerome):**
    *   11bh and 11bi are working on RC issues. 11bh is targeting document completion by mid-2024. 11bi is targeting release in 2026.
    *   11bh is considering a scheme involving access points providing stations with an identifier.
    *   11bi is working on improving the privacy of 802.11 operations.
*   **WPA Open Roaming Experiment Summary (Jon R. and S.):**
    *   Open Roaming aims to provide seamless secure private network access.
    *   The demonstration involved installing credentials (identity) on a device.
    *   Mac address randomization can cause problems for provisioning services.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Use Cases and Problem Statement Document:**
    *   Leave the document as is, until the Bc document is ready, then remove section 7.
    *   Feedback to be sent to the mailing list.
*   **Market Normalization State of Affairs Document:**
    *   Carlos to incorporate feedback on title.
    *   Get at least one or two reviews of the document before working group last call.
*   **Bc Handling Rc:**
    *   Coordinate with key stakeholders to schedule a more in-depth interim meeting on the Bc.
*   **WPA Open Roaming:**
    *   Work with WPA to set up Open Roaming as an experiment in the network for the next IETF meeting (IETF 117).

## Next Steps

*   **Market Normalization State of Affairs Document:** Interested parties to provide reviews and comments.
*   **Bc Handling Rc:** Chair to schedule an interim meeting to discuss the Bc approaches in detail within the next 3-4 weeks.
*   **WPA Open Roaming:** Plan and execute the experiment for IETF 117.
*   Further discussion on all topics should continue on the mailing list.
