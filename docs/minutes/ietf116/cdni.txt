## Summary
This meeting focused on reviewing working group documents and new submissions related to CDN Interconnect (CDNI). Discussions centered on delegated credentials, triggers, capacity advertisement extensions, cash control metadata, secret exchange and a new proposal for footprint extensions.  Several action items were identified related to updating and reviewing drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Delegated Credentials:** Clarification on the scope and purpose of the `CiDedicatedCredentials` and `MriDedicatedCredential` objects, particularly regarding expiry and renewal, and the announcement of maximum credential support. Concern was raised regarding push vs. triggered pull.
*   **CDNI Triggers:**  Discussion on changes to the triggers draft, including renaming "type" to "action," adding a "triggers back list," and adding a generic "engineer extension" list for special execution instructions.  Considerations around the order of "specs" in the trigger object and the handling of duplicates were raised.
*   **Capacity Advertisement Extensions:** Discussion on the removal of the "scope" object and clarification on the configuration property within the telemetry source object. Interoperability concerns regarding the lack of definition for the configuration property were discussed.
*   **Cash Control Metadata:** Discussion on configuration options for setting cash control between UC and DC. This include discussion on I cash policy, negative responses, stall content caching, computing hash key and finally cash bypass policy object.
*   **Secret Exchange:** Discussion on the objects being introduced to exchange sensitive data between CDN components.
*   **Footprint Extensions:** A proposal to extend Fc I to advertise footprints separately from capabilities was presented.
