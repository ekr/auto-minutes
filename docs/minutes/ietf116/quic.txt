## Summary

This QUIC working group meeting covered several key topics, including updates on multi-path QUIC, act frequency, qlog, reliable stream resets, and research on QUIC deployment challenges. Discussions revolved around technical details, implementation considerations, and potential future directions for the protocol. Several decisions were made, and action items were identified to guide future work.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Multi-Path QUIC:**
    *   Debate on stable pass ID versus loose ID model (using DC sequence number).
    *   Error code for missing CID during handshake when multi-path is enabled.
    *   Path status frame and potential for expansion or replacement with multiple frame types.
    *   Returning acknowledgements from different paths and impact on RTT estimation.
    *   Updating path status when CID changes.
    *   Pass setup frame and whether a separate frame is necessary.
*   **Act Frequency:**
    *   Discussions on the reorder threshold and its representation.
    *   Normative language concerning sending acknowledgments at least once per RTT.
*   **qlog:**
    *   Versioning of qlog and additional schemes.
    *   Renaming HTTP category to H3 and Transport category to QUIC.
    *   Multi-path qlog support and needs.
    *   Key packet logging events.
    *   Timestamp handling in qlog.
    *   ECN markings in qlog.
*   **Reliable Stream Resets:**
    *   Proposal to add a payload field to the reset stream frame.
    *   Discussion on the potential to provide a partially reliable stream mechanism.
*   **QUIC Deployment Challenges:**
    *   Multi-RTT handshakes due to large TLS data.
    *   Inefficient retransmission strategy for incomplete handshakes.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Multi-Path QUIC:**
    *   Use loose pass ID model based on DC sequence number.
    *   Define a new error code for missing CID during handshake when multi-path is enabled.
    *   Split path status frame into multiple frames (path standby, path available).
    *   Encourage further discussion on github.
*   **Act Frequency:**
    *   Prepare for working group last call.
    *   Further discussion on how to handle RTT measurements and related error codes.
*   **Reliable Stream Resets:**
    *   Adopt the "reliable reset stream" draft (with modifications based on discussion).
    *   Run an adoption call on the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Register Transport Parameter Times and Errors
*   Final Discussion on the remaining open Github issues.
*   Further implementation experience desired, specifically for multi-path.
*   Multi-Path: Update Github to reflect agreements from meeting.
*   qlog: Prepare a PR to update security considerations to better match multi-path changes
