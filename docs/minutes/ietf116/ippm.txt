# ippm

## Summary
The ippm meeting covered updates on several working group documents, including encrypted PDM, capacity measurement protocols, precision metrics, LAG measurement, responsiveness under working conditions, and data integrity for insecure OEM data fields.  There were also discussions on YANG models for I. and stamp, and several lightning talks presenting potential new work.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Encrypted PDM (Na and Tum):** A major simplification was proposed, involving passing the packet sequence number (Ps) in the clear, eliminating the need for key agreement. Concerns were raised about exposing the Ps, but the presenters argued that the benefits outweigh the risks. The group agreed to revise the document, send it to the mailing list, and then to SEC AD for review.
*   **Capacity Measurement Protocol (Greg):** Security features were added, resulting in partial and full encryption options. A second early security review was received. Brian Place's comments on the choice of AES-GCM and the potential for substitution attacks were discussed.  The group will add a note about the substitution attack to the security considerations section.
*   **Precision Metrics (Greg):** Updates were presented, including the addition of violated packet counts and severe packet counts. "Policy" was replaced with "time configuration duration settings" for terminology clarity. The group will consider working group last call.
*   **LAG Measurement (Karen):** The solution extends STAMP for LAG measurement, adding new command types and micro session IDs. The group will consider working group last call.
*   **Responsiveness Under Working Conditions (Christ):** A revised algorithm was presented, featuring changes to load generation, stability detection, and responsiveness computation. Dns-based service discovery was added. There was discussion about the duration of tests and whether it was too short.
*   **Data Integrity for Insecure OEM Data Fields (Alex):** The presenter suggested including the header integrity protection. The group agreed with the new direction.
*   **I. YANG Model (Karen):** There was discussion about whether to include I. (I-DEX) in the YANG model. Greg argued for inclusion, while Karen initially suggested a separate document. The consensus was that including the full scope, including I-DEX, would be more efficient.
*   **STAMP YANG Model (Greg):** Updates were presented, including revisions to session sender and reflector configurations. Rollback to using IP and UDP port numbers for sender and reflector.
*   **Lightning Talks:**
    *   **Transit Measurement Option (Tall):** Presents transit measurement option (Ip six) for detecting performance issues.
    *   **YANG Model for i. (Shooping):**  Updates the model for i. aiming to target both deployment and the integration with basics
    *   **App Quality Metrics Requirements (Bjorn):**  Presents some requirement for the performance
    *   **Postcard Based Telemetry (Howsong):** Presents some technology classification for Pb for postcard based technologies
    *   **I. (W):** Present some some of the new extension drafts for i. which is Ip fix
    *    **Extend Marketing Method (F):** Extend existing mark methods by providing more data, this will need to have some casting with working group as well

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Encrypted PDM:**
    *   **Action:** Revise the document based on the discussion.
    *   **Action:** Send the revised document to the mailing list for review.
    *   **Action:** After mailing list review, send the document to SEC AD.
*   **Capacity Measurement Protocol:**
    *   **Action:** Add a note about substitution attacks in the security considerations section.
*   **Precision Metrics:**
    *   **Action:** Chairs and group to consider working group last call.
*   **LAG Measurement:**
    *   **Action:** Group to consider working group last call.
*   **Data Integrity for Insecure OEM Data Fields:**
    *   **Decision:** Include header integrity protection in the next revision.
*   **I. YANG Model:**
    *   **Decision:** Include I. (I-DEX) in the YANG model.

## Next Steps

*   Authors will continue to revise and update their respective documents based on the feedback received.
*   The group will continue to discuss and refine the requirements for application quality metrics.
*   Authors are encouraged to work together to address overlapping functionality and terminology.
*   People should come to the Csv area meetings.
