<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 29 Mar 2023 00:30</p>
<h1>vcon</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This meeting was a BoF (Birds of a Feather) session to discuss the proposal for a new IETF working group focused on &quot;conversational data&quot; (vcon). The session covered the background of the vcon proposal, presented use cases, and discussed the proposed charter. The primary goal was to determine if there is sufficient interest and a clear problem definition to form a new working group. The session included discussions about scope, privacy, and the roles of various parties involved.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem Definition:</strong> Connecting disparate levels of the network stack, data silos, and potential interest from other SDOs (Standards Development Organizations).</li>
<li><strong>Use Cases:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Personal data privacy and customer data protection in automotive supply chains.</li>
<li>Integration of conversations and analysis services (AI, machine learning).</li>
<li>Sharing message history across multiple clients for the same user.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Charter Scope:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Defining a container format for conversational content.</li>
<li>Specifying mechanisms for integrity and privacy.</li>
<li>Identifying missing media types (e.g., time-labeled transcripts).</li>
<li>Excluding algorithms for transcript analysis, real-time streaming, transport, and database storage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong>  The definition of &quot;privacy&quot; in the context of vcon was discussed at length. The need to distinguish between internal privacy management and interoperable privacy mechanisms was raised. Discussion on data minimization, redaction, and ensuring a verifiable chain of custody for data.</li>
<li><strong>Auditing and Logging:</strong> The potential for vcon to facilitate auditing and logging of data processing activities was explored.</li>
<li><strong>Workforce Optimization (WFO) Use Case:</strong> Supporting WFO scenarios, particularly quality management, requires including more information about the agent and call details.</li>
<li><strong>Minimal Viable Product:</strong>  The need to identify a minimal, practical use case that could be implemented with a limited set of features was highlighted.</li>
<li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> A key goal is to enable interoperability between different vendors and systems.</li>
<li><strong>Related Work:</strong> The relationship between vcon and other existing data exchange formats and standards was questioned.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Feasibility:</strong> The ability to encrypt individual objects within a vcon container with different keys to control access.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Discussion regarding the people involved in building and using the specifications.</li>
<li><strong>Consent and Data Protection:</strong>  Inclusion of tracking consent of participants as attachments.</li>
<li><strong>Use Case Document:</strong> Suggestion to deliver a use case Internet Draft that is helpful for understanding the scope of the project and can be used by the working group.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> The vcon proponents will revise the proposed charter based on the feedback received during the BoF session. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Clarifying the definition of &quot;privacy&quot; or replacing it with more specific terms like &quot;confidentiality&quot; or &quot;audit log.&quot;</li>
<li>Incorporating the Workforce Optimization use case and related agent/call details.</li>
<li>Adding language to address object-level encryption.</li>
<li>Including the concerns about identity and PII derivatives.</li>
<li>Investigating related work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Create a deliverable for the working group to produce a use case Internet Draft that is helpful for understanding the scope of the project.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Interested parties were asked to contribute to the discussion on the mailing list and provide feedback on the revised charter text.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Those interested in contributing text to vcon documents are to send an email to V con-chairs at I t f dot org.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>The vcon proponents will circulate the revised charter on the mailing list.</li>
<li>The IETF community will review the revised charter and provide feedback.</li>
<li>Further discussion will take place on the mailing list to refine the scope and goals of the proposed working group.</li>
<li>A decision will be made by the area directors on whether to charter a vcon working group based on the revised charter and community feedback.</li>
</ul>
