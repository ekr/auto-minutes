# core Meeting - IETF 116

## Summary

This core working group meeting at IETF 116 covered a wide range of topics related to constrained resource environments, including Concise Resource Identifiers (Cli), conditional attributes, key update mechanisms (Kudos), publish-subscribe architectures, DNS over CoAP, and performance measurement.  Individual submissions on CoAP over BLE, CoAP yacht, and a data model for at-hoc SCORE were also presented. The meeting included document status updates, technical discussions, and a brief discussion on the future direction of several drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Cli (Concise Resource Identifiers):**
    *   Registration of URI schemes as negative integers was discussed. Concerns about the procedural aspects of this registration were raised.
    *   Handling of percent encoding in Cli extensions was discussed. The need for clarity on how to handle CsiIs with unknown extensions was noted.
    *   Discussions on representing empty paths (empty array vs. trailing null) and the need for both representations were documented.
    *   The burden on implementations for strict checking of certain constructs was discussed.
*   **Conditional Attributes:**
    *   The discussion centered on whether the document should be informational or standard track. The importance of considering existing implementations (e.g., in K x Iot) and potential conflicts was highlighted.
    *   The clash with the "observe" functionality and a proposal to use resource state projection to address this was discussed.
    *   Cancellation of resource projection registration via URI with conditional attributes was also discussed.
*   **Using Adequate Core Panel Core:**
    *   Discussion and changes related to payload format, context creation, error handling, target attributes, and authentication credential types.
    *   The working group is ready for shepherd review and write-up.
*   **Key Usage Limits for Os and Key Update for Score (Kudos):**
    *   Key Usage Limits were separated to a new draft.
    *   Discussion on how a PS can update their score and recipient Ids, using a new core option.
    *   The optionality of end yi them kudos to Cd and how peers can also rely on signalling with the no forward bit was mentioned.
    *   Discussion about preventing deadlocks.
*   **Pubsub:**
    *   Discussions on topic properties, the importance of max subscribers, and the fact that its an authorization error not just the protocol mechanism.
*   **YANG and CoAP (sid and Kumar):**
    *   Discussion on the sit location mechanism, the challenges with Jane 2 landscape, and the need for a complete set of data notes.
    *   Handling multiple versions of zip files and the option of overriding the old one, to avoid causing problem.
    *   Full data store access and the data node access operation was discussed.
*   **DNS over CoAP (DoC):**
    *   Addressed DNS directorate feedback and clarified terminology. Discussed implementation of DNS push and transport agnosticism.
    *   Started addressing feedback from ten s up, covering performance advantages, T rewriting, and cache optimization.
    *   Discussion to bootstrap dock in a SRV record and also opened a discussion on the mailing list.
*   **CoAP Platform Performance Measurement:**
    *   Discussions on proxy and safe operations in regards to proxying.
    *   Presentation of different scenarios, including D and Oscar.
*   **CoAP over BLE:**
    *   Introduced a very short header, with tokens similar to what we know from other transports.
    *   The need for discovery topic was discussed and what has to be reviewed by the end user.
*   **Data Model for At-hoc SCORE:**
    *   Presentation of an architecture on how to configure security associations.
    *   Presented two cases, the thing has the at hoc score implementation or just score.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Conditional Attributes:**
    *   Action Item:  Bill to discuss the informational vs. standard track status with K x Iot and Dms.
*   **Using Adequate Core Panel Core:**
    *   Action Item: Jacob to upload the issue to the issue tracker on talk.
*   **Using Adequate Core Panel Core:**
    *   Action Item: Chair to discuss with the shepherd review and write-up.
*   **CoAP Platform Performance Measurement:**
    *   The document will move forward with the working group adoption code.
    *   Action Item: Christian to copy with Ipm and point some cautions about traffic.

## Next Steps

*   **Cli:** Further discussion on remaining questions on the mailing list and at the next interim meeting.
*   **Conditional Attributes:**  Await outcome of discussions with K x Iot and Dms regarding the document's status.
*   **Sid and Kumar:** Incorporate feedback from discussions and continue development.
*   **All Documents:** Authors to address open pending points and solicit feedback on mailing lists.
*   **Interim Meetings:** The group plans to resume interim meetings every other Wednesday in the European afternoon starting from April twenty six. A confirmation will be sent through the mailing list in one week.
