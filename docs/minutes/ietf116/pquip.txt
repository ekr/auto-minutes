# pquip

## Summary
This was the first working group meeting for pquip.  The main topics discussed were the hybrid terminology document, a planned guidance document for engineers on post-quantum crypto, and a "grand list" of IETF working groups and protocols considering post-quantum algorithms. A presentation was given about potential patent issues related to post-quantum cryptography and Crystal K.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Hybrid Terminology Document:**  The group discussed whether to adopt the current draft, which aims to standardize terminology for hybrid post-quantum/traditional crypto schemes. There was debate over the best terminology, especially regarding the "PQ/" prefix. The document will be adopted but is expected to undergo further revisions.
*   **PQ Crypto for Engineers Guidance:**  The group needs someone to take ownership of this document. Tim volunteered.  He will start a mailing list thread soliciting questions from those new to post-quantum cryptography to define the scope of the document. The document will leverage material from RFC 9340 and other sources.
*   **Grand List of Protocols:**  This is a GitHub-hosted list of IETF protocols and working groups that are considering post-quantum cryptography migration. Contributions are welcome via pull requests or mailing list suggestions. Discussions included listing protocols outside the IETF (e.g., IEEE), protocols where PQ solutions have not yet been identified, and protocols using pre-shared keys. Sections for "orphan protocols" and constraint analysis will be added. A volunteer will maintain the pre-shared key section of the list.
*   **Patents and Post-Quantum Crypto:**  A presentation was given regarding N's published list of potential patents related to Crystal K and their licensing agreements. This information was presented as factual, not as legal advice. The group discussed the process for IP disclosure within the IETF (RFC 79) and potential concerns and different patent laws in different countries.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Adopt Hybrid Terminology Document:** The hybrid terminology draft will be adopted as a working group document.
*   **Tim to Lead Engineer Guidance Document:** Tim will lead the drafting effort for the PQ Crypto for Engineers document, starting with a question-based thread on the mailing list.
*   **Expand Grand List:** The grand list will be expanded to include:
    *   Protocols outside the IETF (e.g., IEEE)
    *   Protocols where PQ solutions have not yet been identified ("suspected problem" protocols)
    *   Pre-shared key-based schemes (a section to be added and maintained by Russ)
    *   Constraint analysis documents related to PQ adoption in specific protocols
*   **Post-Meeting: Chairs will send links to the group of key documents.**

## Next Steps
*   Call for adoption of the hybrid terminology document on the mailing list.
*   Tim to start mailing list thread for defining the scope of the engineer document.
*   Solicit contributions to the grand list via pull requests or mailing list.
