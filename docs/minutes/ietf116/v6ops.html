<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 27 Mar 2023 00:30</p>
<h1>v6ops</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The v6ops meeting covered several important topics related to IPv6 deployment and operation. Presentations included updates on IPv6 education initiatives, frameworks for IPv6 as a service, operational issues with hop-by-hop options, prefix delegation in home networks, CDN behavior with IPv6 extension headers, using DHCPv6 prefix delegation, IPv6 multi-homing, and IPv6-only resolvers in NAT64 environments. Discussions were lively, reflecting the ongoing challenges and potential solutions for broader IPv6 adoption.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>IPv6 Textbook for College Students:</strong>  Progress is being made, with contributions and commits steadily increasing.</li>
<li><strong>IPv6 for Enterprise:</strong> Work is ongoing to address IPv6 deployment challenges in enterprise networks.</li>
<li><strong>Framework for Multi-IP Network &amp; IPv4 as a Service:</strong>  The draft has been updated based on feedback and is progressing.  The use of IPv6-only headers was proposed for brevity.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Issues with Hop-by-Hop Options:</strong>  The draft is considered mature and ready for working group last call.</li>
<li><strong>IPv6 Prefix Delegation in Home Networks:</strong> Discussion focused on hierarchical vs. flat delegation models and the implications for router configuration.  The benefits of standardising on the approach were discussed.</li>
<li><strong>CDN Behavior with IPv6 Extension Headers:</strong> Testing revealed inconsistencies in CDN handling of extension headers, but improvements were observed. Discussion around proxy implementations in CDNs impacting EH functionality was discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Using DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation:</strong> Proposal to use DHCPv6-PD instead of address assignment for IPv6 to scale the network resources. Concerns were raised about tracking user behaviour with it.</li>
<li><strong>IPv6 Multi-homing:</strong> An informational draft outlining the challenges and options for IPv6 multi-homing was presented. There are operational challenges involved.</li>
<li><strong>IPv6-Only Resolver in NAT64:</strong> Proposal to have IPv6 only the way to resolve. It addresses the case where some people are using Diana six four not sixty four.</li>
<li><strong>IPv6 stack migration:</strong> Dual stack migration for in-house private cloud.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hop-by-Hop Options Draft:</strong> The draft is targeted for working group last call.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-homing Draft:</strong> Additional text on the issues with using one address space on another provider will be added.</li>
<li><strong>Prefix Delegation Draft:</strong> Add examples for host. The text related to Host and separate Pd were to be updated. The document will need some new text.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussion on the IPv6 prefix delegation draft on the mailing list.</li>
</ul>
