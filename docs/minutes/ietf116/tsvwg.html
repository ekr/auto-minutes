<h1>tsvwg</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The TSVWG meeting covered several important topics, including updates on existing drafts, discussions on congestion control, and proposals for new work items. Key discussions revolved around the maturity and progression of drafts related to Diffserv, UDP options, and congestion control mechanisms. The meeting also addressed the challenges of balancing performance optimization with fairness and security in modern transport protocols.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>L4S Operations Draft:</strong> Discussion on adding text recommending the alternative fallback behavior with an email to be sent to the list.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Q Building PH Draft:</strong> Discussion on resolving the remaining 13 issues, specifically the upper bound on application data rate for labeling and applications traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Multipath TCP Draft:</strong> Discussion and show of hands regarding moving the draft from experimental to proposed standard track.</li>
<li><strong>UDP Options Drafts (DP to U, UDP Options):</strong> Discussion of changes made and upcoming need to resolve final issues.</li>
<li><strong>Careful Provisions for Congestion Control Draft:</strong> Discussion of positioning this work in the IETF and possibility of adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Criteria for Congestion Control Behavior Draft:</strong> General disucssion requesting help and advise on approach.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>L4S Operations Draft:</strong> Chairs to work with Greg to send an email to the list soliciting explicit comments on the suggested text regarding fallback behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Q Building PH Draft:</strong> Greg to resolve the remaining 13 issues and provide a revised draft. Mailing list to be used for discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Multipath TCP Draft:</strong> Continued discussion on the mailing list regarding the proposed status change to &quot;Proposed Standard&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Careful Provisions for Congestion Control Draft:</strong> The working group voted to adopt this draft. Further discussion to decide on the approach and scope on the mailing list. Chairs to review and report back.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors of drafts to address open issues and feedback received during the meeting.</li>
<li>Continued discussion on the mailing list for outstanding issues and proposals.</li>
<li>Preparation for the next TSVWG meeting on Thursday.</li>
<li>Chairs to follow up on action items and facilitate progress.</li>

<h1>tsvwg</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The second tsvwg meeting covered several topics, including detail security for SCTP, zero checksums in SCTP, SCTP authentication, SCTP over UDP, shared IP solutions, and media header extensions for wireless networks. The main discussion revolved around the direction of detail security for SCTP, with concerns raised about implementation challenges. The working group also discussed the adoption of the zero checksum draft. Several requests were made for feedback and reviews on the presented drafts.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detail Security for SCTP (Magnus):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Alternatives to detail over SCTP, focusing on well-known, maintained, and individually used security protocols.</li>
<li>Concerns raised by Michael regarding implementation complexity in the kernel.</li>
<li>Discussion on handling restarts and dynamic configuration with the proposed detail security solution.</li>
<li>Need for feedback from 3GPP and other stakeholders regarding the proposed changes to detail security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Zero Checksums on SCTP (Michael):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Motivation: Saving CPU cycles when running SCTP over DTLS, where DTLS provides sufficient protection.</li>
<li>Clarification that the proposal is about CPU savings when the checksum doesn't provide additional value.</li>
<li>Adoption call: Working group agreed to adopt the draft, pending further review and addressing concerns on the mailing list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SCTP Authentication (Michael):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updating the authentication draft to address issues raised by Eric and incorporate socket API considerations.</li>
<li>Magnus highlighted the dependency of this draft on the decision of the direction of security for SCTP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SCTP over UDP (Michael):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Integrating text submitted for Rc 6951 into a single document for SCTP with UDP.</li>
<li>Call for reviewers for this draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Shared IP Solutions (Lewis Chan):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Problem: How to enhance user experience on services running over shared IPv4 addresses (CGNAT).</li>
<li>Presentation of the stateless cgNAT solution: a novel approach for port forwarding without third party coordination.</li>
<li>Discussion deferred to the mailing list due to time constraints.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Media Header Extensions for Wireless Networks (John):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Problem: Poor media quality due to transient channel quality drops in wireless networks.</li>
<li>Proposal: Using a UDP option for providing metadata (priority and burst length) for packet scheduling.</li>
<li>Request for feedback and suggestions on the proposed solution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> The working group agreed to adopt the zero checksum draft (Michael), pending further review and addressing concerns on the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Magnus to engage with 3GPP and other stakeholders for feedback on the detail security proposal.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Working group to discuss the direction of security for SCTP and conduct a consensus call on the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Solicit reviewers for the SCTP over UDP draft (Michael).</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Request feedback on Lewis Chan's cgNAT proposal on the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Working group members to review John's media header extensions draft and provide feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Conduct a consensus call on the mailing list regarding the future direction of detail security for SCTP.</li>
<li>Gather feedback on the presented drafts from the working group and relevant external parties.</li>
<li>Address comments and issues raised in the discussions and incorporate them into the respective drafts.</li>
<li>Continue discussion on the mailing list for topics that could not be fully covered during the meeting.</li>
</ul>
