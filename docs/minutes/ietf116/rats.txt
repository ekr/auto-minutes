## Summary

This session of the Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) working group covered a wide range of topics including media types for Evidence/Attestation Results, the COSE Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) representation for endorsements, Delegated Attestation (Da), message wrappers, the role of endorsements, an approximate location claim, epoch markers, and an EAT realization of the Air Force information model. The working group discussed the status of various drafts, considered adoption calls, and addressed open issues.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **EAT Media Type:** The discussion centered on issues with the `+json` suffix and early allocation. The group agreed to proceed with a working group last call and assess the need for early allocation based on the progress.
*   **COSE for Endorsements (COSE):**  Progress was reported on adding a "Bill of Materials" tag and conditional endorsement triples. The target date for working group last call is September 2023.
*   **Delegated Attestation (Da):** A solution for integrating Da into the connection was presented. The working group agreed to issue a last call for the Da draft.
*   **Message Wrappers:** Adoption of the message wrapper format was discussed with consideration for dependencies on other drafts, particularly the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) architecture. Agreement was reached to request clarification during the adoption call.
*   **Endorsements:** A draft explaining the role of endorsements was presented. The discussion focused on the security considerations and the relationship between current state, reference values, and appraisal policies. Dave Taylor will update the draft, after which the working group will re-evaluate its adoption.
*   **Approximate Location Claim:**  A new claim for conveying approximate location using secure ranging was introduced. Gary and Hank agreed to continue discussions offline.
*   **Epoch Markers:** Adoption of a specification for epoch ID types was requested. The group will proceed with an adoption call, taking into account feedback on terminology.
*   **EAT for Attestation Results (EARF):** The group discussed whether EARF should be a working group item or simply an EAT profile. Dave Taylor suggested incorporating it into the existing EARF SI document. A decision will be made after further discussion on the mailing list.
