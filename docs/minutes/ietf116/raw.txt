## Summary

The RAW working group meeting covered document status updates, presentations on use cases, mobility, and OAM, and a discussion about the future of the architecture draft and the working group itself. Rick and Eve announced their intention to transition out of their chair positions, with a plan to potentially merge the RAW group back into the DETNET working group. The meeting concluded with decisions on document progression and next steps for the working group's future.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Status:** The L-Strap has been published as an RFC. The Use Cases draft is awaiting IESG review. The Technologies draft awaits shepherd write-up. The Architecture draft remains a key point of discussion.
*   **Mobility Draft:** Initial feedback suggests interest in the mobility problem, independent of specific solutions. Applicability across multiple lower layers (e.g., WiFi in addition to 5G) was seen as a valuable aspect.
*   **OAM Draft:** The OAM draft is considered stable and ready for working group last call, pending discussion on architectural dependencies.
*   **WG Chairs Transition:** Rick and Eve are transitioning out of their roles as WG chairs. A potential merger with DETNET is being considered.
*   **Architecture Draft:** A joint working group last call with DETNET was proposed to gain broader review and consensus.
*   **Industrial Requirements Draft:** Additional co-authors may be sought to help progress the expired Industrial Requirements draft.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Use Cases Draft:** Await IESG review and publication.
*   **OAM Draft:** Proceed to working group last call.
*   **Architecture Draft:** Conduct a joint working group last call with DETNET. Eve volunteered to be a shepherd for the joint last call
*   **Industrial Requirements Draft:** Reach out to the original authors and solicit additional co-authors to help progress the draft. Carlos volunteered to help.
*   **Technologies Draft:** Carlos to provide a write-up as shepherd.
*   **Transition to DETNET:** Discussion to be held on the mailing list regarding the process, timeline, and steps for transitioning RAW into DETNET.

## Next Steps

*   Chairs of both RAW and DETNET to discuss and coordinate the joint last call for the architecture draft.
*   Eve to contact the original authors of the industrial requirements document and introduce them to Carlos.
*   Begin discussion on the mailing list about the transition of RAW into DETNET.
