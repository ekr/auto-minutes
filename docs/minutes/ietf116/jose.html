<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 27 Mar 2023 06:30</p>
<h1>jose</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The re-chartered JOSE working group held its first meeting. The primary focus was on the adoption of three JSON Web Proofs (JWP) specifications as working group items. Discussions covered the charter, related specifications, and potential future work items. The working group discussed milestones and potential use of a wiki page. The working group decided to move the drafts into the JOSE GitHub repository.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Charter Review:</strong> A review of the re-chartered working group's focus on privacy-preserving technologies, particularly zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and selective disclosure. The charter includes work on use cases, standard track documents for representing independently disclosed data and proofs, and collaboration with other working groups.</li>
<li><strong>JSON Web Proofs (JWP) Presentation:</strong> Mike Jones presented the JWP specifications, outlining a new container syntax for supporting ZKPs and selective disclosure. JWP aims to provide native support for multiple, selectively disclosed payloads and proofs of knowledge. The design considerations included privacy features (selective disclosure, proof of knowledge) and keeping the format flexible and simple.</li>
<li><strong>JWP Adoption:</strong> The working group discussed adopting the three JWP specifications (container format, algorithms, and token format) as working group items. The consensus was to adopt these drafts as a starting point for further development.</li>
<li><strong>Milestones and Use Cases:</strong> The working group discussed defining milestones and the usefulness of a use case document. There was discussion of whether the use case document should be a deliverable or an informal wiki page. The decision was to solicit contributions on the mailing list and revisit the deliverable status later.</li>
<li><strong>Cose and Jose:</strong> Discussion on which group to work on documents that could either go here and find both, you know, Jose and Jose, or should we just split, Right? Should we have one draft for each? The consensus was that the Jose working group should ensure that the container format supports all approved algorithms, regardless of whether they're specifically ZKP-related.</li>
<li><strong>Test Vectors:</strong> Emphasis on the importance of test vectors for interoperability and implementation verification. Suggestions included machine-generated test representations and external tools for generating test vectors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> The working group reached rough consensus to adopt the three JWP specifications as working group items, pending confirmation on the mailing list.
<ul>
<li>Action Item: Chairs to send a call for adoption to the mailing list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Move the drafts into the JOSE GitHub repository.
<ul>
<li>Action Item: Transfer the github repos into the JOSE github org.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Chairs to call for contributions for the milestones (especially the use case document) on the mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Formally adopt the three JWP drafts after the mailing list vote.</li>
<li>Begin soliciting contributions and feedback on the adopted drafts, focusing on the container format, algorithms, and security considerations.</li>
<li>Determine the approach for documenting use cases (informal wiki or formal informational document) based on community participation and input.</li>
<li>Establish a JOSE GitHub repository.</li>
<li>Determine whether virtual interim meetings are needed based on the pace of progress on the mailing list and GitHub.</li>
</ul>
