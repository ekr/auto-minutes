<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This DHCP working group meeting covered several key topics: an update on the draft for registering self-generated IPv6 addresses using DHCPv6, a proposal for distributing SRv6 locators via DHCP, and the progress of advancing DHCPv6 (RFC 8415) to an Internet Standard. Discussions included refinements to existing drafts, potential adoption of new proposals, and the future of the working group.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registering Self-Generated IPv6 Addresses:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lorenzo presented updates to the draft, including renaming the message to &quot;Inform&quot; and adding an acknowledgement (ACK) mechanism.</li>
<li>The retransmit logic was aligned with RFC 48514 behavior.</li>
<li>A mechanism for clients to release addresses by setting lifetimes to zero was added.</li>
<li>The document currently registers an address from an end station.</li>
<li>The working group discussed whether the DHCP server could register the address on behalf of the end station.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about switches relaying the message and potential race conditions with clients also sending the messages.</li>
<li>It was suggested that implementers should have a way to configure whether hosts perform address registration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Distributed SRv6 Locator:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Michel presented a proposal to distribute SRv6 locators via DHCP, treating them as prefixes.</li>
<li>The proposal aims to simplify configuration and enable dynamic learning of SRv6 locators in large-scale deployments.</li>
<li>Spring working group has reviewed positively, considering it helpful for IPv6 networks.</li>
<li>Eric stated that a simple option should be considered as a requesting working group for adoption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advancing DHCPv6 to Internet Standard:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The group reviewed the criteria for advancing RFC 8415 to an Internet Standard.</li>
<li>A list of existing implementations is being compiled, with a focus on implementations of RFC 8415.</li>
<li>It was decided to remove text related to the &quot;Use Multi Cast&quot; status from the RFC 8415 update.</li>
<li>The goal is to post an updated version in May, resolve outstanding comments, and submit it for publication in June.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Future of the Working Group:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Eric proposed keeping the working group dormant for a period after RFC 8415 is advanced to an Internet Standard, rather than closing it.</li>
<li>There was general agreement that closing the group would be premature, given ongoing DHCP-related developments.</li>
<li>The possibility of DHCP-related work being done in other groups was mentioned.</li>
<li>It was agreed that this would be the primary discussion at the next meeting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registering Self-Generated IPv6 Addresses:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item (Lorenzo):</strong> Add text explaining the expected behavior of snooping relays and switches regarding DHCPv6 Inform messages.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Lorenzo):</strong> Add implementation considerations about configuring hosts to disable address registration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Distributed SRv6 Locator:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item (Tim):</strong> Send an email to the Spring chairs to determine where the document should be adopted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Advancing DHCPv6 to Internet Standard:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item (Tim):</strong> Remove text related to the &quot;Use Multi Cast&quot; status in the RFC 8415 update.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Tim):</strong> Add FreeRADIUS to the list of implementations of RFC 8415.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Tim):</strong> Schedule a last call for the updated document in May.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>C for Address Notification</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item (Lorenzo):</strong> Remove experiment label and declare the call production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lorenzo to update the &quot;Registering Self-Generated IPv6 Addresses&quot; draft based on meeting feedback.</li>
<li>Tim to contact the Spring chairs regarding adoption of the SRv6 locator proposal.</li>
<li>Tim to prepare and post an updated version of RFC 8415, resolving comments and removing &quot;Use Multi Cast&quot; text, targeting a May release and subsequent last call.</li>
<li>Further discussion on the future of the working group at the next meeting (IETF 117).</li>
