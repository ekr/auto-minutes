## Summary
The IDR working group meeting covered a range of topics including working group status updates, adoption calls, and presentations on various draft proposals. Key areas of discussion included BGP Class Transfer Templates (Ct), extensions for SR policy advertisement, YANG models for BGP, and solutions for connecting IPv4 islands over IPv6 cores. Several presentations focused on addressing specific issues and enhancements to existing drafts, with calls for working group review and implementation feedback.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Working Group Status:** Updates on completed and ongoing work, including RFC publications and drafts progressing through the IETF queue.
*   **Adoption Calls:** Status of adoption calls for several drafts, with a reminder to provide feedback on drafts nearing adoption decisions.
*   **BGP Class Transfer Templates (Ct) & BGP Card:** Progress updates on these drafts, focusing on addressing issues raised in the Github repositories, and demonstrations of interoperability.
*   **SR Policy Advertisement:** Splitting of a single draft into two, separating SR policy advertisement from other traffic engineering (TE) policy advertisements.
*   **BGP YANG Model:** Discussion of challenges in modeling AS paths and community regular expressions, with proposals for standardization.
*   **IPv4/IPv6 Transition:** Presentation on using BGP to advertise IPv6 prefix information for IPv4/IPv6 translation.
*   **IPv4 Islands over IPv6 Core:** Presentation on a draft addressing connectivity solutions for IPv4 islands over IPv6 cores, highlighting the need for BGP-based solutions.
*   **Template ID on the head end of the AS policy:** Discussion about the implementation, configuration and deployment of the template ID, its identity and coordination.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Ct and Card issues to address:** The Ct and Card team will work towards closing the issues in order to have better last calls
*   **Interim Topics:** Discuss terminal caps labels stacks, version capability, and send hold timer in depth at the April 24th interim meeting.
*   **SR Policy Implementation feedback:** The authors of SR policy advertisement drafts will be sharing or putting across the implementation report to get feedback.
*   **Yang Model Shepherd:** G will write the shepherd report.
*   **IPv4/IPv6 loop prevention draft:** The authors will consider Ls r comments and the old RFC, and re-evaluate the draft.
*   **Contact Sue:** Those involved in working with SR policy or related drafts are asked to contact Sue to help expedite getting the drafts to a working group last call.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing lists for drafts presented, especially concerning BGP YANG model, Ct, Card, and IPv4 Islands over IPv6 core proposals.
*   Authors to address working group feedback and prepare updated drafts.
*   Working group review and provide input for drafts approaching working group last call.
*   Address and work on the Github issues related to Ct and Card.
*   Discuss listed topics at the interim meeting on April 24th.
