## Summary

This meeting of the opsawg working group covered several topics, including updates on drafts related to IPFIX, data model manifests, network inventory, forwarding exceptions, green networking metrics, and digital twins. The discussions included calls for adoption, requests for reviews, and exploration of potential future work items. There were discussions about overlaps in different drafts and the need for coordination and a common base model.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **On-Path Delay in IPFIX:** Implementation updates from Cisco and Huawei were presented, highlighting real-world deployments.
*   **IPFIX Revision:** Proposed plans to fix issues in the IPFIX registry, including a working group last call for an update to RFC 7125 and adoption requests for related drafts.
*   **Data Model Manifests:** Changes were presented in the data model to clarify that the goal is to store data independently of the device, focusing on a network model. Discussions included inventory modeling.
*   **Forwarding Exceptions:** Updates were given to a draft on forwarding exception codes and lookup types. A poll was raised to evaluate the working group's interest.
*   **Service Attachment Points (SAPs):** An overview was provided with associated models and services.
*   **Network Inventory Model:** Use cases and relationships to other drafts were discussed. The need for generalized components and device attributes was discussed. A dedicated working group was recommended.
*   **Data for Asset Lifecycle Management (DAML):** Changes from the previous version were presented, including renaming licenses to entitlements.
*   **Green Networking Metrics:** A draft defining metrics for energy usage and carbon footprint was reviewed. Security considerations were highlighted.
*   **Digital Twins:** A discussion about digital twin maps, requirements and implementation.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IPFIX Revision:** Raise a request for working group last call on the list for the update to RFC 7125 upon return from IETF 116.
*   **Data Model Manifests:** Raise a call for adoption for the manifests draft on the mailing list.
*   **Forwarding Exceptions:** Raise a more formal call for adoption.
*   **Network Inventory Model:** Join the "inventory-yang" mailing list.
*   **DAML:** provide feedback on list for the call for adoption on DAML
*   **Green Networking Metrics:** Bring the topic up on the list

## Next Steps

*   Further discussion on the mailing lists for the various drafts.
*   Coordinate with other working groups regarding overlaps in the different drafts on inventory, attachment circuits and energy metrics.
*   Explore the potential formation of a dedicated working group for inventory modeling.
