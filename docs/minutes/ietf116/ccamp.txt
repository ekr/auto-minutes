## Summary

The CCAMP working group met to discuss the status of ongoing drafts and new proposals related to data models for optical networks and network slicing. The agenda included updates on drafts in the editor's queue, drafts undergoing review, and new work areas. Key topics included optical impairment aware topology models, OT slicing, flexi-grid, microwave topology, network topology abstraction, and client signal performance monitoring. The meeting also touched on coordination with other working groups, such as TEAS and NETMOD.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Optical Impairment Aware Topology Model:** Updates included terminology alignment with G.827, support for remote optical connections, media channel group protection, and YANG updates related to media channels and optical impairment profiles.  The working group agreed to request a YANG doctor review.
*   **OT Slicing:** Discussion focused on separating network slice topology models from technology-specific details.  Dependency on an individual draft for network slice topology was a key issue, with a preference for adopting the draft within the TEAS working group.  Technology-agnostic attributes were also discussed, with a plan to align with the Ns YANG.
*   **Flexi-Grid:**  New requirements for mixed-technology network views were presented, affecting existing drafts. The WG is considering merging the WSON and flexi-grid documents. A document that has already passed last call will be brought back to the working group for updates.
*   **Microwave Topology:** The microwave topology draft has been split into three drafts to separate generic bandwidth availability and interface reference modules.  A desire to move to last call was expressed, as well as questions about where the bandwidth availability and interface reference models should ultimately live.
*   **Network Topology Abstraction:**  Discussion centered on the use of separate route containers for topology and inventory, as well as clarification of terminology related to location. Suggestions were made to check existing database standards, such as ITU recommendations.
*   **Client Signal Performance Monitoring:** The working group will further review the performance monitoring and modeling of client signals
*   **Topology and Orchestration for Packet Network (TOP):** A recently presented instant Management solution, will be assessed for possible extensions in the CCAMP working group.
*   **Network Slice Policy:** A recap of the topic to be presented in a TEAS Working group.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Request YANG doctor review of the optical impairment draft.
*   **Action Item:** Present bandwidth availability and interface reference drafts to the NETMOD working group to determine a suitable home.
*   **Action Item:** Send a mail to the CCAMP mailing list to describe the benefits and potential weaknesses of the new requirements presented within the Flexi-Grid draft and solicit additional feedback from operators.
*   **Action Item:** Work will continue on the different model and continue discussion in weekly calls.

## Next Steps

*   Address open issues in the discussed drafts.
*   Continue coordination with other working groups (TEAS, NETMOD, OPSAWG).
*   Work on clarifying location terminology in the Network Topology Abstraction draft.
*   Progress discussed drafts towards last call as appropriate.
