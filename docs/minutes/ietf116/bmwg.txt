## Summary
The BMWG meeting covered several draft updates, proposals for new work, and requests for working group adoption. Discussions focused on benchmarking methodologies for next-generation firewalls, stateful NAT64/44 gateways, containerized infrastructure, segment routing (SRv6 and SR-MPLS), and integrated space and terrestrial networks (ISTN). A key theme was the need for more community involvement in reviewing drafts and providing feedback.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Next Generation Firewall Benchmarking:** Successfully published.
*   **NAT64/44 Gateway Benchmarking:** Discussion of using multiple IP addresses to better reflect real-world traffic.  The author will implement and then bring back results before a WG Last Call
*   **Containerized Infrastructure Benchmarking:**  The draft was updated and a request for adoption was made, but more reviews are desired first. M and F, search draft authors, signed up to review this.
*   **SRv6 Benchmarking:** An updated draft incorporates feedback and a request for working group adoption was made. The group needs to engage and help with testing. Micro-SID was discussed but deemed out of scope.
*   **SR-MPLS Benchmarking:** An updated draft incorporates feedback.  A question was asked about longer label lists and QOS. The author will need to address questions on the ML before an adoption call.
*   **ISTN Benchmarking:** Focus on defining parameters and setting up the benchmarking environment. Discussed data sources (regulatory, satellite, cross-sourcing). Feedback requested. The use of Ping to measure latency on slide 12 was questioned.
*   **Multiple Loss Ratio Search:** Updates made. Describes a method with different time trials to determine if an offered load is to high or to low.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **NAT64/44 Gateway Benchmarking:** Author to implement multiple IP address proposal and present results for further discussion before considering WG Last Call.
*   **Containerized Infrastructure Benchmarking:** M and F, the search draft authors, will review the draft. Another person will review it too. The WG will wait for these notifications before replacing the adoption call.
*   **SRv6 Benchmarking:** Topic to be taken to the mailing list to solicit volunteers for review. An adoption call will only be made if volunteers come forward.
*   **SR-MPLS Benchmarking:** Topic to be taken to the mailing list to solicit volunteers for review. An adoption call will only be made if volunteers come forward. The author should check the correct references.
*   **ISTN Benchmarking:** The next step is to focus on representatitive parmaters.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address feedback and implement proposed changes in their respective drafts.
*   Working group chairs to actively solicit reviewers for drafts via the mailing list.
*   Schedule adoption calls based on review availability.
*   Encourage authors to work together and authors to review each other's drafts.
