<h1>sidrops</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The SIDROPS meeting at IETF 116 covered several key topics, including a presentation on RPKI deployment experience, a discussion on AS-path object (AS-PA) deployment, an update on the Slur for AS project, an update on the Roa best current practices document, a proposal for a new RPKI object profile (AS-Sets), and a discussion of RPKI key rollover. The discussions focused on the challenges of RPKI deployment, potential solutions for improving the system, and the need for better coordination and standardization.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>RPKI Deployment Experience:</strong> Randy presented findings on RPKI deployment, highlighting slow propagation times, time zone issues, and the impact of relying party (RP) software.  He stressed the slowness of withdrawals compared to announcements. Path hunting was also discussed.</li>
<li><strong>AS-PA Deployment:</strong> Joe Snyder shared updates on AS-PA deployment at the Calgary Internet Exchange (YIX), including their experience with rejecting invalid routes and the importance of early filtering.</li>
<li><strong>Slur for AS:</strong> The Slur for AS project was discussed, with emphasis on simplifying local internet number resource management, especially during incidents. There was discussion about the scope and purpose of Slur for AS, specifically related to assertions vs filtering semantics.</li>
<li><strong>Roa Best Current Practices:</strong> An update was provided on the Roa Best Current Practices document. A request for working group last call was issued, but one issue was raised regarding the complexity of the ASN.1 module that needs to be resolved during the last call.</li>
<li><strong>New RPKI Object Profile (AS-Sets):</strong>  A proposal for a new RPKI object profile (AS-Sets) was presented to address gaps between RPKI and IRR, and to improve upon the functionality that AS-Sets in the IRR provide. It generated debate about its authority and relationship between members, and what it is meant to improve upon in contrast to ROA.</li>
<li><strong>RPKI Key Rollover:</strong> A discussion was held regarding RPKI key rollover, focusing on the challenges of coordinating changes between child and parent CAs and the need for a graceful transition strategy. A best practices document was proposed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Joe Snyder to consider data collection and experiments based on feedback received during the presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Working group last call to be issued for the Roa Best Current Practices document. The discussion about the complexity of the ASN.1 module will happen during the last call.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Work will be done on both a best practice document that details how you can do the key rollover manually, and standards document for an automated rollover.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussions on Slur for AS on the mailing list to clarify use cases and required semantics.</li>
<li>Address the issues raised regarding the ASN.1 module during the working group last call for the Roa Best Current Practices document.</li>
<li>Develop a best practice document for manual RPKI key rollover and explore the potential for a standards document for automated key rollover.</li>
</ul>
