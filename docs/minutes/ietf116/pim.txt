## Summary
The PIM working group meeting in Yokohama covered a wide range of topics related to multicast routing and address allocation. Key discussions included updates on existing drafts, presentations on new protocols like PIM-FRR based on TI-LFA and GAP, and considerations for scaling multicast deployments. The group also discussed the need to update older RFCs like 1112.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **PIM Election Drafts:** Progress needed on existing PIM election drafts.
*   **RFC Status:** Updates on several RFCs approved for publication (register packing, a-start packing, proxy YANG).
*   **BIZ Documents:** Discussion of moving IGMP and MLD to full Internet Standard via BIZ documents.
*   **PIM Light:** Presentation on PIM Light, focusing on point-to-point deployments, TCP interaction, and the need for clarity regarding multi-access considerations.
*   **PIM-FRR based on TI-LFA:** Presentation on a new mechanism for PIM-FRR based on TI-LFA and requests for working group last call
*   **Backup DR:** Presentation on backup DR election and sticky DR behavior with a discussion of interactions with another related draft.
*   **GAP (Group Allocation Protocol):** Presentation on a new decentralized multicast group allocation protocol with discussion of collision resolution, security, and API design.
*   **Zero Config Multicast Address Allocation:** Presentation on a zero-configuration approach to multicast address allocation for layer 2 networks using mDNS.
*   **MLD Proxy with Multi-Streaming Interfaces:** Presentation on supporting multiple interfaces in MLD proxies with different access technologies.
*   **RFC 1112 Update:** Discussion on updating RFC 1112 to remove IGMPv1, apply to IPv6, and incorporate ASM terminology.
*   **Scaling Multi-Cast using Tunnels:** Presentation around how to scale the different dimensions that exist when considering multi-cast networks

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **P2P Policy PING:** Resend a new email requesting early allocation for P2P Policy PING to the ADs and Mp chairs, copying the original request.
*   **PIM Light:** Update the PIM Light draft based on feedback received, clarifying its applicability to point-to-point deployments and addressing multi-access concerns.
*   **PIM-FRR based on TI-LFA:** Take the PIM-FRR draft to the mailing list to determine if there is any outstanding feedback before beginning working group last call.
*   **Backup DR:** Analyze the interplay between the sticky DR approach and another draft, and discuss which one works best.
*   **GAP (Group Allocation Protocol):** Need to better explain to other members how to resolve collision
*   **RFC 1112 Update:** Tore to discuss updates with Jim (the AD) regarding process.

## Next Steps
*   Discussions on various topics will continue on the mailing list.
*   Adoption calls for several drafts will be initiated on the mailing list.
*   Further testing and development of GAP will be conducted.
*   Further development and analysis for the Backup DR case will be done
