<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This document presents the minutes for the TEAS (Traffic Engineering Architecture and Signaling) IETF meeting. The meeting covered updates on existing drafts, adoption calls for new drafts, and discussions on various technical issues related to network slicing and traffic engineering. Key topics included the applicability of Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN) to network slicing, network slice YANG data models, and the realization of network slicing in IP/MPLS networks, particularly in the context of 5G.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>ACTN Applicability Draft:</strong> Discussion around adding a discussion point and potential requirement for an X-interface Northbound from the MDSC for network slice orchestration requests.</li>
<li><strong>Network Slice YANG Data Model:</strong> Concerns raised regarding the definition and meaning of &quot;isolation&quot; in the YANG model and its relation to VPN+ discussions. The proposal of using horizontal or vertical realization for cloud RAN use cases was discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Realizing Network Slicing in IP/MPLS:</strong> Focus on reusing existing IP/MPLS technologies for 5G slicing, mapping 5G QoS requirements to transport network behaviors.</li>
<li><strong>Network Slice Association:</strong> Discussion on the relationship between the NBA (Network Business Architecture) YANG model and service/network models and potential for merging content into the ACTN applicability document.</li>
<li><strong>Network Slice Architecture:</strong> This area focuses on understanding and realizing model architectures based on defined network parameters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>ACTN Applicability Draft:</strong> Authors to address the issue of X-interface Northbound.</li>
<li><strong>Network Slice YANG Data Model:</strong> Working group to find a solution for the definition of &quot;isolation&quot; that satisfies everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Network Slice Association:</strong> Authors to discuss merging content into the ACTN applicability document.</li>
<li><strong>Adoption Call for Network Slice Application Draft:</strong> Call for adoption will proceed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to update drafts based on the discussion points.</li>
<li>Working group members to review updated drafts and provide feedback on the mailing list.</li>
<li>Continue discussions on open issues on the mailing list.</li>
<li>The team will align with the latest version of the NBA young model.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This session covered several important topics including the merging of the An Policy and An Network Framework drafts, a new draft idea for network slice topology, service assurance requirements, updates on the TERRA project, attachment circuits in network slicing and tactical traffic engineering. The main discussions revolved around potential overlaps and inconsistencies between existing models, the scope and maturity of different drafts and the interaction between different control mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Merging An Policy and An Network Framework:</strong> The authors are merging these drafts into a single NLP YANG draft. The discussion focused on separating the device model and network model into different modules and reusing modules for performance status and resource utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Network Slice Topology:</strong> A new draft defines a network slice topology model for customized connections within a slice. The discussion centered around the relationship between this model and the existing network slice YANG model, and whether the topology information should be integrated into the NS model or kept separate.</li>
<li><strong>Service Assurance:</strong> A new service assurance document was introduced, leading to discussion on duplication with the existing Po document and the potential overlap with work in the OPS area.</li>
<li><strong>TERRA Project:</strong> An update on the TERRA project, an open source cloud-native controller, was provided, highlighting its support for multiple technologies and standardized protocols.</li>
<li><strong>Attachment Circuits:</strong> A presentation covered attachment circuits in network slicing, addressing potential inconsistencies and limitations in existing service models.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical Traffic Engineering (TTE):</strong> TTE aims to alleviate congestion in real-time by utilizing backup paths. Potential issues with multiple concurrent congestion events and interactions with longer-term network optimization by controllers were discussed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>An Policy and An Network Framework:</strong> Authors to publish the merged draft in the current week.</li>
<li><strong>Service Assurance:</strong> Authors to remove duplicated text and reference existing sections.</li>
<li><strong>TERRA Project:</strong> Chairs to investigate adding the Github repository to the data tracker as an additional resource.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network Slice Topology:</strong> Further offline discussion to resolve open issues and reach a consensus among authors.</li>
<li><strong>Service Assurance:</strong> Issue a new version of the document after removing duplicated text.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical Traffic Engineering:</strong> Discussion with the RT chairs regarding a suitable home for the TTE work.</li>
</ul>
