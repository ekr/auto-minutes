# 6man

## Summary
The 6man meeting covered several important topics, including updates on existing drafts, discussions on new proposals, and announcements regarding related work. Key discussions revolved around the V-ID option, stateless address autoconfiguration, limiting extension headers, hop-by-hop processing, and generalized IPv6 tunnels. There were also lively debates on the complexity and practicality of proposed solutions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **V-ID Option:**
    *   Clarification on the relationship between V-ID and network slicing was sought.
    *   The intended use cases and drivers were discussed, distinguishing between operational markers and application needs.
    *   The performance impact of adding additional headers was raised, with a request for statistics.
*   **Improving the Robustness of Stateless Address Autoconfiguration:**
    *   Concerns were raised regarding the complexity of the active avoidance algorithm and its impact on existing implementations.
    *   The need to balance the complexity of multi-prefix/multi-router scenarios with simpler single-router cases was highlighted.
    *   The impact of packet loss on mobile devices and the lifetimes for prefixes were also questioned.
*   **Limiting Extension Headers:**
    *   The need for a routing area review was noted.
    *   The default number of non-padding options, padding options, and the IPv6 header chain length were discussed.
    *   Empirical data on the real-world behavior of devices when large extension headers are used was suggested.
*   **Hop-by-Hop Processing Procedures:**
    *   The importance of defining "full forwarding rate" and addressing potential reordering issues were discussed.
    *   Considerations for the size of options and the number of hop-by-hop options were raised.
    *   The use of terminology concerning nodes versus routers was discussed to make sure the proper devices were addressed.
*   **New Proposed DHCPv6 Options:**
    *   A new flag within router advertisements was proposed to allow DHCPv6 for prefix delegation to handle situations with multiple interfaces.
    *   The DHCPv6 options allow scaling of IPv6 address space for VMs.
    *   Concerns about legacy support were raised.
*   **Generalized IPv6 Tunnels:**
    *   A side meeting on generalized IPv6 tunnels (G-IPv6) was summarized.
    *   Key questions discussed included the relationship between G-IPv6 and existing tunnels, extending existing IPv6 tunnels, and whether G-IPv6 is necessary for campus and data center networks.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Stateless Address Autoconfiguration:** Continue discussion on the mailing list due to time constraints.
*   **Limiting Extension Headers:** Request a routing area review.
*   **Hop-by-Hop Processing Procedures:** Revise the draft based on comments and then ask for a working group last call.
*   **New Proposed DHCPv6 Options** Submit the draft to the DHCP working group

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on open issues via the mailing list.
*   Incorporate feedback into revised drafts.
*   Initiate working group last calls for applicable documents.
