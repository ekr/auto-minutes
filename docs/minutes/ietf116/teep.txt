## Summary

The TEep working group meeting covered updates on the hackathon, the keep-over-HTTP transport specification, and the protocol draft. Discussions focused on error handling, agent authentication, Eat profiles, and the integration of suit manifests. Several issues were addressed, and a path forward was discussed regarding normative dependencies.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Hackathon Update (Akira):**
    *   Implemented and verified the draft.
    *   Clarified the use of Cnf for compromised agent situations by adding it to query requests.
    *   Discussed the compromised TEE broker scenario, concluding no action is needed as the TEE agent key pair is independent.
    *   Addressed token handling in PAM and resolved matching query requests and responses with deep updates, success/error returns.
    *   Discussed the use of CDDL ( Concise Data Definition Language) and an update mechanism.
*   **Keep-over-HTTP Transport Specification (Dave):**
    *   Addressed comments from IAD and area reviewers including timeout handling, HTTPS recommendation, consistency in terminology, URI dereferencing, and cash control headers.
    *   Clarified the use of HTTP status codes.
*   **Protocol Document (Dave, Akira):**
    *   Added the ability for the TAM to send error messages to the agent.
    *   Integrated the Cnf claim to bind attestation results to specific agents, preventing unauthorized use of attestation claims.
    *   Defined required claims in the Eat profile.
    *   Clarified the relationship between the TEE profile and the AR4SI. Defined three cases for TAM behavior based on protocol support.
    *   Specified the use of Suit inside the Eat manifest claim for software component names.
    *   Summarized mandatory implementation algorithms and crypto suites.
    *   Discussed encryption algorithms for Eat and suit reports, proposing the use of the same algorithm for both.
    *   Addressed the discrepancy between the current draft and the suit MtI document due to last-minute changes, which need to be brought into alignment.
*   **Normative Dependencies:**
    *   Concern was raised regarding normative dependencies on evolving drafts (Eat, Suit, Firmware Encryption, Trust Domains, Reference Interaction Models).
    *   Potential to change Firmware Encryption to an informative reference.
    *   Discussed potential issues with the dependencies.
*   **CDDL Updates:** Akira noted the need to update both the .md and .CDDL files in the GitHub repository to avoid future dependencies on the T protocol CDDL file.
*   **Cnf Public Key Hashing:** Implementers are looking for guidance on how to properly encode the public key hash used within the Cnf claim.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Dave:** To publish draft 15 of the Keep-over-HTTP transport specification.
*   **Dave:** Update the protocol draft to replace Hp with Ec and clear any references to CH draft, to align with the Suit MtI specification.
*   **Dave:** Evaluate and potentially change the Firmware Encryption to informative reference in next draft.
*   **Akira:** To provide a link to the mail list with the code where the implementations are having an issue with the Cnf hashing algorithm.

## Next Steps

*   Dave to address the action items and prepare a new draft of the protocol.
*   Working group to review and provide feedback on the updated drafts.
*   WG chairs to assess the maturity of normative dependencies and initiate working group last calls when appropriate.
*   Request from working group for Hank to prioritize the reference interaction models so that the working group can complete the non specification of the protocol draft.
