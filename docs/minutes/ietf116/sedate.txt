# sedate

## Summary
The sedate working group meeting focused on the remaining issues for their current document, which addresses hints for date and time information. Discussions centered on clarifying error handling, refining terminology, and resolving references, particularly regarding the C r data. The group also addressed the next steps for publishing the document and its implications for closing the working group.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Charter Update and Document Status:** Discussed the updated charter to include a specific fix related to RFC 3339 and the submission of the document to the IESG.
*   **AD Review:** Discussed the received AD review and the need for editorial fixes, more detail on error handling, designated expert guidelines, and the reference to C r.
*   **C r Reference:**  Extensive discussion regarding the reference to C r and its Xml file on Github.  The stability and appropriate way to reference this information was questioned. It was determined the IANA will be contacted to find a more stable reference in cooperation with the Unicode Consortium.
*   **Error Handling:**  Detailed discussion of error handling, specifically regarding conflicting items and the use of critical flags. A decision was made on how to handle duplicates with and without critical flags.
*   **Terminology:** Clarification of the terminology used within the document, specifically "tag", "key", and "value".
*   **Legacy GMT:** Mention of and subsequent removal of legacy GMT time zones to avoid incorrectly encoded issues.
*   **Working Group Closure:** The intention to close the working group after the current document is published was discussed.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Justin Grant to update the P r with changes based on the agreed-upon handling of duplicate calendar annotations, where if any duplicate annotations are marked as critical, the whole thing is invalid.
*   **Action Item:** Someone is to contact IANA regarding a more stable reference for the Unicode C r data. Bro was volunteered for this.
*   **Decision:** Working group closure will be proposed once the current document is published.
*   **Decision:** Reject any date or time data containing duplicate annotations where at least one annotation is marked as critical.

## Next Steps

*   Justin Grant to update the P r with the discussed changes.
*   Submit updated ID based on the discussed changes.
*   Bro to contact IANA regarding a stable reference for C r data.
*   Submit the document for last call after the charter is approved.
*   Propose working group closure upon successful publication of the document.
