## Summary

This dnssd working group meeting focused on the status of several drafts and considered adoption of new work. Key discussions included final changes to the S sop and Update Lease drafts, the scope of the Advertising Proxy draft, multi-stream discovery using DNS, and a progress report on S sop replication interoperability testing. The working group agreed to submit the S sop and Update Lease drafts for publication, and expressed interest in adopting the S sop replication draft.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **S sop and Update Lease:** Final editorial changes were reviewed and approved. The documents are ready for submission.
*   **Advertising Proxy:** The scope of the advertising proxy draft was discussed.  The group considered whether to split it into smaller, more focused documents due to scope creep. Ted volunteered to write supporting documents.
*   **Multi-Stream Discovery:** Nate Car presented a proposal for multi-stream discovery using DNS, including a new special use domain (`in-cast.arp`). There was interest in the approach, but the group decided to discuss the draft on the mailing list before considering adoption.
*   **S sop Replication Interoperability:** Ted reported on the interoperability testing of the S sop replication draft. Progress was made, but the testing was not fully completed. The group discussed challenges encountered with service discovery and transport layer issues.
*   **Ts (Time Since Registered):** The purpose and benefits of the Ts draft were discussed. In particular, it helps prioritize the most recent updates and reduces problems with stale data in multi-server setups.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** The working group agreed to submit the S sop and Update Lease drafts to the IESG for publication.
*   **Decision:** The working group expressed interest to adopt the S sop replication draft and a poll for adoption was held.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs to confirm the vote on the mailing list.
*   **Action Item:** Ted to find a co-author with a non-Apple affiliation for the Ts draft before adoption is considered.

## Next Steps

*   Submit S sop and Update Lease drafts for publication.
*   Discuss Nate Car's multi-stream discovery draft on the mailing list.
*   Confirm working group adoption of the S sop replication draft via the mailing list.
*   Ted to find a co-author with a non-Apple affiliation for the Ts draft.
*   Plan for another S sop replication interoperability testing event.
