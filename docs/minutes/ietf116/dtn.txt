## Summary

The Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) working group met to discuss several key topics, including updates to the IP URI scheme, DTN Management Architecture (DMA), Asynchronous Resource Updates Identifier (ARUI), and application layer protocols over Bundle Protocol (BP) such as email and HTTP. The meeting also touched on Bundle Protocol Endpoint Identifier (EID) patterns and a real-world perspective on DTN adoption. Key discussions revolved around streamlining IP URI allocation and encoding, refining DMA for challenged network environments, simplifying ARUI syntax, and determining the optimal approach for application layer integration with BP, considering security, usability, and standardization efforts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IP URI Scheme Update:**
    *   Removal of rationale text and rewriting as a specification.
    *   Splitting the document into two parts: IP URI scheme and encoding for BPv7.
    *   Introduction of authority numbers and their impact on addressing and routing.
    *   Discussion on numbering authority allocation policy, including expert review and experimentation.
*   **DTN Management Architecture (DMA):**
    *   Updates based on feedback from the previous session.
    *   Emphasis on open loop control, autonomy, and compression for challenged networks.
    *   Use of pre-shared data definitions and local autonomy engines.
    *   Command-based management approach.
*   **Asynchronous Resource Updates Identifier (ARUI):**
    *   Simplification of the ARUI syntax and binary encoding for ease of implementation.
    *   Explicit categorization of ARIs as literals or object references.
    *   Use of CBOR for binary encoding and a context-free grammar for text encoding.
*   **Application Layer Protocols over BP (Email and HTTP):**
    *   Encapsulating standard internet email and HTTP within BP for space and challenged environments.
    *   Discussion on SMTP over BP and the trade-offs between encapsulating entire messages versus message store synchronization.
    *   Concerns raised about security for HTTPS over BP.
    *   Consideration of multiplexing and unsolicited responses.
*   **Bundle Protocol EID Patterns:**
    *   Introducing a standardized way to address and reference EIDs via patterns.
    *   Use cases include security identities, routing blocks, and policy configuration.
    *   Pattern matching using literals, wildcards, regular expressions, and integer ranges.
*   **Practical DTN Adoption:**
    *   Real-world examples of using DTN in industrial services and space applications.
    *   Emphasis on tolerance to disruptions and the importance of designing applications with this constraint in mind.
    *   Discussion of delay and loss resilience and potential areas for improvement.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IP URI Scheme Update:**
    *   Action: Post concerns/opinions to the mailing list regarding the two documents.
    *   Action: Rick and Ed will create an updated draft that addresses comments, aiming for working group last call soon.
    *   Action: Take the Slash Notation discussion to the mailing list.

*   **Email over BP:**
    *   Action: Define a problem statement regarding exchanging email in a DTN and whether we want S/MIME over BP.

## Next Steps

*   Focus discussion on the mailing list regarding the benefits of HTTP and email encapsulation versus higher-level functions like synchronization of message stores.
*   Continue reviewing the DMA draft and provide feedback for working group last call.
*   Further refine and implement the URI and IP addressing documents based on list discussion.
*   Continue real-world testing and integration with a variety of scenarios.
