## Summary
The NETMOD working group session at IETF 116 covered several topics, including updates on existing drafts, discussions on new proposals, and implementation experiences. Key discussion points included Ethernet YANG models, YANG versioning, system-defined configurations, security considerations, immutable data, and representing unknown YANG bits. The session concluded with an implementation report on YANG augmentations and a call for interim meetings to further discuss specific topics.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Ethernet YANG Models:** Update on drafts related to common interface extensions and sub-interfaces. Discussion on removing a reference to an expired draft and considering an attachment circuit model.
*   **YANG Versioning:** Update on the YANG version solutions drafts, including module revision handling, semantic versioning, and comparison tooling. Discussion focused on on-wire vs. schema changes, error message compatibility, and comparison scope. The group would appreciate more operational voices to participate in meetings.
*   **System Defined Configuration:** Discussion on the system-defined configuration draft, including the reliance system parameter and the validation of referenced configurations. A poll was conducted to gauge support for moving to the interpretation that running is valid.
*   **YANG Security Considerations Template:** Presentation on the use of the YANG security considerations template by the IEEE. Discussion on licensing and the process for updating the template in the future.
*   **Immutable Data:** Presentation on a draft to formally document immutable data in YANG. Discussion on use cases, existing implementations, and the relationship to liaison requests.
*   **Representing Unknown YANG Bits:** Proposal to define a typed def for unknown bits in YANG bit vectors. Discussion on whether the proposal should be a standards-track or informational document.
*   **BGP Model Experience:** Overview of lessons learned developing the BGP YANG model.
*   **Incident Management Draft:** Discussion of a YANG model for incident management focusing on a service level.
*   **YANG Augmentation Report:** Experiences on difficulties to use YANG data augmentations in voucher scenarios and a call for feedback.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Ethernet YANG Models:** Remove the informative reference to the expired `ieee802-l2vpn-yang` draft after sending a message to the list and addressing comments about the attachment circuit model. Aim for last call between IETF 116 and 117.
*   **YANG Security Considerations Template:** Rob Wilson will produce an AD-sponsored draft for the template text. The draft will proceed through the process and allow the trust to license it. Future updates can be done via a "bis" document.
*   **Immutable Data:** Working group will consider adopting this work.
*   **Follow Up:** Bump mailing list messages for Michael's repos with various methods to use augmentations to the top of the list.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for YANG versioning, system-defined configuration, and representing unknown YANG bits.
*   Schedule interim meetings to further discuss Michael's Yang augmentation and Bgp modeling experiences.
