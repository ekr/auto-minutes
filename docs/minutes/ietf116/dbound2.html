## Summary

This meeting discussed the potential for chartering a working group to address use cases related to domain name boundaries and administrative relationships.  The primary focus was on identifying specific use cases with potential solutions, particularly those addressing shortcomings of the Public Suffix List (PSL) without necessarily duplicating its functionality.  Discussions revolved around decentralized approaches, scalability challenges, and defining clear authority for adding entries.  A decision was made to defer chartering, requesting participants to develop draft charters and solutions based on the discussed use cases for further evaluation.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Problem Statement:** The group revisited the problem statement from a previous effort, acknowledging that it may have been too broad with too many use cases. A focus on incremental growth, starting with straightforward cases, was suggested.
*   **Public Suffix List (PSL):** Much of the discussion centered around the PSL, its limitations, and potential for complementary solutions. Paul Hoffman presented a use case for complementing the PSL with DNS-based protocols to allow zone owners to add data without going through the PSL process.
*   **Decentralization &amp; Scalability:** Ian from AWS presented a use case for a decentralized and distributed alternative to the PSL, driven by the need to manage a large number of domain names across many services and regions. Scaling issues associated with a centralized approach were highlighted.
*   **Authority &amp; Trust:**  John Levin emphasized the importance of defining a clear process for establishing authority to add entries to any alternative system, particularly to avoid malicious submissions.
*   **Defining Boundaries:** A key question was whether the working group should focus on asserting things about domains *below* a boundary (exclusive model) or requiring agreement across the boundary (inclusive model), with the observation that the DMARC use case influenced the previous effort but is now considered out of scope.
*   **Metadata &amp; Responsibility:**  Verner suggested a need for metadata beyond simple hierarchical relationships to describe responsibility and ownership of domain names, going beyond a simple &quot;public suffix&quot; designation.
*   **Charter Scope:**  The group discussed the need for any new charter to explicitly reference and address the PSL, clarifying its relationship to any proposed solutions.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **No chartering at this time:**  The group decided that it was not ready to charter a working group.
*   **Draft Development:** Participants are requested to develop draft charters and potential solutions (documents/drafts) based on the identified use cases.
*   **Focus on specific use cases:** Any new work is expected to focus on a smaller set of use cases, specifically related to domain name boundaries.
*   **Address the PSL:** Any proposed charter should explicitly reference the Public Suffix List and clarify how any proposed solutions relate to its functionality and limitations.

## Next Steps

*   Participants will work on draft charters and potential solutions addressing the use cases discussed.
*   These materials will be shared and discussed on the mailing list.
*   The topic will be revisited at a later time, potentially at the next IETF meeting in July, after further development of drafts and charters.
