## Summary

The intarea working group meeting discussed four main topics: a liaison letter from IEEE 802, the draft "intarea, Rf c seventy, forty two biz aya considerations and protocol. Documentation usage. For I eight zero two. Parameters", Ip addressing with references, and a service-aware networking framework. A new draft regarding trusted domains for SRv6 was also announced.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Liaison Letter from IEEE 802:**
    *   The letter provided comments on a draft related to 802.1 standards and requested that references to IEEE 802 standards be definitive.
    *   Discrepancies between the public ether type lists managed by IEEE and IANA were discussed, and coordination efforts to synchronize these lists were highlighted.
*   **RFC 7042 bis (AYA Considerations):**
    *   A draft version of RFC 7042 bis was presented, incorporating suggestions from IEEE 802.
    *   Discussions included the process for applying for ether types, vendor-specific terminology, and clarifications on informative vs. authoritative references.
    *   A problematic change requested by IEEE 802 related to the specification of local MAC addresses assigned via protocols was discussed. The group needs to resolve this issue.
*   **IP Addressing with References:**
    *   A draft proposing a method for using references in IP addresses for private networks to facilitate peer-to-peer communication without address duplication was presented.
    *   The proposal involved a combination of standard network addresses and locally assigned opaque references.
    *   Concerns were raised regarding the security implications of publishing private IP addresses in DNS and the lack of negotiation. The presenter tried to address that the solution wasn't negotiated.
*   **Service-Aware Networking Framework:**
    *   A framework for service-aware networking was presented, focusing on identifying services at the network layer.
    *   The framework aimed to adapt the network to be aware of computing resources and service requirements, especially in cloud and edge computing scenarios.
    *   Differences between the proposed framework and other efforts like "Intent Definition at (ID)" were briefly discussed.
*   **Trusted Domains for SRv6 (Announcement):**
    *   A new draft on trusted domains for SRv6 was announced, with a request for community review and feedback. The draft aims to enhance the security around SRv6.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **RFC 7042 bis:**
    *   Donald will create a new draft version of RFC 7042 bis, incorporating non-controversial changes suggested by IEEE 802.
    *   The chairs will draft a liaison response to IEEE 802, clarifying the group's position on the problematic change related to local MAC address assignment.
    *   The new version will be sent to IEEE 802 for review, while simultaneously initiating a working group last call with a longer-than-usual duration.
    *   The group will wait to hear from IEEE 802 on the problematic parts before moving forward.
    *   The IETF coordination mailing list should be notified of these steps.

## Next Steps

*   Donald to prepare RFC 7042 bis draft version 2.
*   Intarea chairs to draft and send a liaison letter to IEEE 802.
*   Initiate Working Group Last Call for RFC 7042 bis after draft is published.
*   Take questions and feedback about "IP Addressing with References" and "Service-Aware Networking Framework" to the mailing list for further discussion.
*   Review and provide feedback on the "Trusted Domains for SRv6" draft.
