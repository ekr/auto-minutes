# rswg

## Summary

The rswg meeting covered two main topics: the "as implemented" document for XML RFC and non-ASCII character handling in RFCs. The discussion on the "as implemented" document focused on migrating existing content, defining a clear plan for future changes, and addressing backwards compatibility. The non-ASCII character discussion revolved around revising RFC 7997, with a focus on simplifying rules and determining the scope of allowed characters.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **"As Implemented" Document:**
    *   The plan is to have a unified document for RFC 3.1 and "as is" with changes migrated to an appendix, allowing reconstruction of both versions.
    *   Issues should be filed against the document, discussed on the mailing list, and ideally accompanied by GitHub issues.
    *   The final document should clearly indicate what is "as implemented" and what changes are planned.
    *   Concerns were raised about maintaining the ability to determine the current RFC grammar during the changes.
    *   There was a discussion on whether the final version will be fully backward compatible and what to do if not. A flag day with a new XML version was proposed as one potential solution.
    *   Setting up CI for the draft was discussed to allow contributors to test their changes locally.
*   **Prep Tool Discussion:**
    *   Concerns were raised about the prep tool adding default values and other elements that generate noise in the document.
    *   The usefulness of the table of contents being added by the prep tool was debated.
    *   The x include function of the prep tool was identified as important to keep.
    *   There was a discussion on whether prep tool output constitutes a policy issue.
*   **Non-ASCII Character Handling (RFC 7997 Revision):**
    *   The RFC stream approval body and the Rpc now decide on the non-ASCII characters allowed in an Rf.
    *   The current draft does not require marking non-ASCII characters, but allows it.
    *   Carson proposed starting from base principles to create a new draft, as he believes that RFC 7997 limits acceptable characters.
    *   Should the focus be on where characters are restricted? The point of Unicode should be to allow it for use by the user.
    *   Including smart quotes were suggested, but was determined to not be included.
    *   Several meeting participants voiced support for Paul’s document.
    *   Several meeting participants voiced for developing a new document.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** Adopt the "as implemented" document as a working group document.
*   **Decision:** Adopt Paul’s Non-ASCII character doc.
*   **Action Item:** File issues against the "as implemented" document on GitHub and discuss them on the mailing list.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs will foster discussion of the principles of how existing XML should be changed on the mailing list.
*   **Action Item:** Create design team of how the prep tool and how it effects the publication and offer side.
*   **Action Item:** Paul to extend his document on typing and math.
*   **Action Item:** List to discuss with streams on the current document.

## Next Steps

*   Rev the draft "as implemented" document based on feedback and address backward compatibility concerns.
*   Paul Hoffman and John Levine will rev the Non-ASCII document based on feedback.
*   Continue the discussion on the mailing list regarding principles for modifying existing XML.
*   Define a precise process for identifying and numbering elements.
