## Summary

The httapi working group met in Yokohama to discuss the status of existing documents, proposed new documents, and other business. Key topics included problem details, YAML media type, item potency key, rate limit headers, deprecation headers, link relationship types for authentication, and a byte range patch media type proposal. Several decisions were made regarding the next steps for these documents, including further discussion on the mailing list and calls for adoption.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Problem Details:** Discussion on the naming conventions for future standard members of the problem object, particularly concerning XML serialization.
*   **YAML Media Type:** Review and discussion on pending issues, notably recommending a single file extension (.yaml vs .yml).
*   **Item Potency Key:** Debate on representing UUIDs in structured fields, specifically whether to use string or binary types.
*   **Rate Limit Headers:** Consideration of rethinking the approach to rate limiting with structured fields, exploring potential future directions for the header.
*   **Deprecation Header:** Debate over the header field's future, with exploration of combining with a more comprehensive API lifecycle header and existing usage vs standards.
*   **Link Relationship Types for Authentication:** Introduction and discussion on a proposal for new link relationship types for authentication, including `authenticate`, `authenticated-as`, and `logout`.
*   **Byte Range Patch Media Type:** Presentation of a proposal for a new media type to facilitate byte range patching, segmented uploads, and optimized file formats.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Problem Details:** Use "std-" prefix for standard-defined XML problem details extensions, include text noting limitations for XML serialization, and confirm on the list.
*   **YAML Media Type:** Consider recommending ".yaml" as the preferred extension and confirm this decision on the mailing list.
*   **Item Potency Key:** Seek author's choice between string or binary structured fields for EuUID representation but favoring string based on meeting feedback. Aim to finalize the document for last call by the end of April.
*   **Deprecation Header:** Continue discussion on the mailing list to determine the next steps: continue with the deprecation header or explore a more comprehensive API lifecycle approach.
*   **Link Relationship Types for Authentication:** Issue a call for adoption on the mailing list.
*   **Byte Range Patch Media Type:** Author to revise the document based on feedback received and seek adoption on the mailing list.
*   **Rate Limit Headers:** Daryl to co-author the draft.

## Next Steps

*   Continued discussion on the mailing list for all topics with pending decisions.
*   Formal call for adoption for the proposed link relationship types for authentication.
*   Revised drafts to be submitted for byte range patch media type proposal
