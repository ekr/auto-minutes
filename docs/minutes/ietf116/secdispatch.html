## Summary

This meeting covered several topics related to security considerations in various areas, including email encryption, network identification fields, X.509 policy validation, and secure routing. Key discussions revolved around the appropriate venue for standardization and the need for further discussion and refinement of the proposed solutions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Clear Text Email Copies:** Discussion centered around a draft proposing a mechanism to signal the sending of clear text email copies alongside encrypted versions. Concerns were raised about whether this is a protocol or a user agent feature. Several participants suggested more discussion is needed. Potential dispatch locations include lamps, emailcore or a new working group. Chairs will discuss this with Art to figure out next steps.
*   **Security Considerations for Tenant ID and Similar Fields:** A draft addressing security considerations for network identification fields within a domain was presented. There was no conclusion on where the document should be dispatched but that discussion on the list is needed. Suggestions included routing, transport, security, or ops areas. It was also suggested to improve the draft based on feedback.
*   **Updates to X.509 Policy Validation:** A draft updating the algorithm for X.509 policy validation to address exponential space complexity issues was discussed. The consensus was to dispatch the document to the Lamps working group.
*   **Secure Routing and Security Functions, Capabilities, Exposure:** A presentation on security function capabilities exposure, prompted discussion about secure routing. The main issue raised was that its application to routing means that it would be better placed in the routing area.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Clear Text Email Copies:** Chairs will coordinate with Art to decide on the next steps and potential dispatch location for the draft.
*   **Security Considerations for Tenant ID and Similar Fields:** No dispatch yet. Discussion should continue on the mailing list to refine the draft based on received comments.
*   **Updates to X.509 Policy Validation:** The draft will be dispatched to the Lamps working group.

## Next Steps

*   DKG will follow up with the SecArea chairs.
*   Authors should continue refining their drafts based on feedback received during the meeting and on the mailing lists.
*   Further discussion on dispatch is needed.
