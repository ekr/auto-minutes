## Summary

The DMM working group meeting covered several key topics, including updates on existing drafts, discussions on mobility and traffic steering in 5G and beyond, and considerations for emergency calling over Wi-Fi. The meeting addressed challenges related to mobility management, network slicing, and ensuring reliable communication in distributed environments. Several authors presented their drafts and solicited feedback from the working group.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Mobility Aware Transport Network Slicing:** Update on the draft, addressing terminology alignment with DMM framework and clarifying 3GPP function impact. Concerns raised about context clarity (transport of mobility vs. mobility of transport), and the use of UDP source port for mobile context identification within the data model.
*   **Mobile Traffic Steering:** Discussion on the problem of steering traffic from application services towards the current active mobility anchor for a mobile device.  Considerations included the value of IP address continuity, potential gaps requiring standardization, and the technical scope of the work. Different control and forwarding planes were briefly discussed, together with the form that documentation should take. A general unease was expressed at the 3GPP-centric focus of this area.
*   **TD-Sec:** Presentation on integrating access node-based user plane functions (UPF) for Beyond 5G/6G, with a focus on satellite integration.  Discussion of use cases, benefits, and challenges, particularly in relation to 3GPP standards and potential contributions from IETF protocols.
*   **E911 over Wi-Fi:** Discussion on supporting emergency calling (E911) over Wi-Fi networks, particularly in scenarios where cellular connectivity is unavailable. The proposal involved standardizing an emergency passport profile for Wi-Fi access points, but there were concerns regarding scope and relevance. The problems of location identification and spoofing were raised.
*   **H-Map with SRv6:**  Presentation on the H-Map architecture using Segment Routing IPv6 (SRv6) for distributed radio networks. Discussion on data plane options and the level of granularity for route advertisement.
*   **Mobility Capability Negotiations:** Discussion on translating mobile session information into routing information using segment routing for 5G use cases.
*   **Mobility Pattern Based Protocol Selection:**  Discussion on protocol selection for mobility management, aiming to improve efficiency and reduce load in 5G systems. The possibility of using mobility pattern as a parameter during the user mobility information collection was raised.
*   **Mobility in Raw Networks:** Presentation on enabling mobility in reliable and available wireless (RAW) networks. The proposal focused on extending existing protocols with new messages and mobility options.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Mobility Aware Transport Network Slicing:**
    *   **Action Item:** John to clean up the draft and address the concerns regarding context clarity and Udp source port usage.
    *   **Action Item:** Authors to address concerns regarding 3GPP involvement and alignment with existing and developing standards.
*   **Mobile Traffic Steering:**
    *   **Action Item:** To continue discussions on the mailing list to clarify scope, potential gaps, and relevance to the working group, bearing in mind the goal of avoiding 3GPP-centricity.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of presented drafts to address feedback and continue discussions on the mailing list.
*   Working group to review drafts and provide comments.
*   Continued discussion on the scope and relevance of various topics, especially concerning 3GPP-centricity.
*   Present Carlos' work at RAW.
