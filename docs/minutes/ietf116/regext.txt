## Summary
The regext working group meeting focused on the status of existing drafts and considered proposals for new work. Discussions included the Reverse Search Capabilities document, the Redacted Fields in RDAP document, and the Federated Authentication for RDAP document. Two new work proposals were presented: RDAP Versioning and an extension for setting delegation TTL values (EPTL).

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RDAP Reverse Search Capabilities:** Last call extended, seeking broader participation and confirmation of "no objection" from at least five participants.
*   **International Email Address Document:**  Sitting in the IESG queue; chairs to confirm version 18 addresses outstanding issues before release.
*   **Redacted Fields in RDAP:**  Considered "plate and ready to go"; working group last call to follow the reverse search document. Early review encouraged.
*   **Simple Registration Reporting & Registration Data Dictionary:**  Coordination of efforts planned; data dictionary portion of the reporting document to be merged into the registration data dictionary document.
*   **Federated Authentication for RDAP & OpenID:**  Feedback from prior last call addressed; ready for another working group last call.
*   **RDAP Versioning:**
    *   Proposed extension to version other extensions, using major/minor versioning.
    *   Addresses the challenge of clients understanding data formats as extensions evolve.
    *   Provides mechanisms for clients to discover supported versions and specify desired versions.
    *   Debate on whether versioning should be mandatory for future extensions.
*   **EPTL Extension:**
    *   Addresses the issue of long TTL values on delegations hindering domain name changes.
    *   Proposes new extension elements to set TTL values for domain names and host objects.
    *   Discussion on how the extension interacts with the host attribute model and the potential for separate TTL values for different record types (NS, DS).
    *   Concerns raised regarding reliance on change polling due to registrar inconsistencies.
*   **JSON Contact Documents:**
    *   Discussion about the Ui property.
    *   Discussion about transition from Jak to Js contact.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Chairs (Jim Gal and Antoine Sure):**  Confirm that version 18 of the International Email Address document addresses all outstanding issues.
*   **Jim Gold:** Prepare the Redacted Fields in RDAP document for working group last call after the RDAP Reverse Search Capabilities last call concludes.
*   **Scott Hollenbeck:** Prepare Federated Authentication for RDAP & OpenID for working group last call.
*   **Tom Harrison:** Consider the proposed changes to the Deli Relations sections and create a new draft version.
*   **Mario:** Post again topics about JSON Contact Documents to facilitate the discussion again on the main list.
*   **Daniel K:** Send a message to the chairs to ask for the RDAP versioning document to be adopted.
*   **Gavin:** Addressed unresolved issues in the EPTL Draft, and provide the possibility to adopt this documents to the working group.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for all documents.
*   Working group last calls for:
    *   RDAP Reverse Search Capabilities (ongoing).
    *   Redacted Fields in RDAP (following Reverse Search).
    *   Federated Authentication for RDAP & OpenID (following Redacted Fields).
*   Consider working group adoption of the RDAP Versioning and EPTL proposals.
