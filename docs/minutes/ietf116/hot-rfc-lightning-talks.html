<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 26 Mar 2023 09:00</p>
<h1>Hot RFC Lightning Talks</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This session featured a series of lightning talks on various Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) related topics, ranging from IPv6 options hiding to data privacy and network automation. The talks were concise and aimed to generate interest and collaboration within the IETF community.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hiding IPv6 Options (Donald Eastlake):</strong> Discussed a method to hide IPv6 options in packets traversing networks that may discard or mistreat packets with hop-by-hop options. The approach involves replacing the next header value of zero with an opaque protocol number. The change is easily reversible at the egress. Seeking comments and potential implementers.</li>
<li><strong>JSON Format for Conversations (Thomas):</strong> Presented a proposal for a new JSON format called the &quot;Econ Standard&quot; designed to represent conversations including dialogues, parties, analysis of the data, and attachments. The main use cases are privacy and customer data protection.</li>
<li><strong>DetNet for Industrial Operations (Karen):</strong> Focused on extending Deterministic Networking (DetNet) for industrial automation, allowing cloud operation of devices. Key issues discussed include application interfaces, mapping requirements, command sending to field devices, cloud integration, and traffic pattern support. Collaboration and feedback were solicited.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomous System Information Service (Asus) (Casper):</strong> Introduced an early-stage research project called Asus, a self-hosted approach for sharing interoperability and topology information of communication networks, contrasting it with existing systems like PeeringDB. It aims to share more network information, including technical and security contact information, BGP routing communities, and data laws.</li>
<li><strong>Research and Analysis of Standardization (RAS) (Alicia):</strong> Promoted the RAS research group, focusing on research and analysis of standardization processes within the IETF. They plan to release open-source tools and collaborate with different people.</li>
<li><strong>DNS Resolver as Certificate Validator (Ted):</strong> Proposed using DNS resolvers to validate TLS certificates to reduce the burden on certificate authorities. Local DNS servers would perform validation on behalf of clients and cache the results. It brings up the need for secure connections between the client and the DNS server.</li>
<li><strong>Data Centric Digital Right Framework (Jean Aj):</strong> Introduced a new framework called the Data Centric Digital Right to address issues related to data privacy and human rights in the digital realm. The framework consists of three principles: I my data. Visible support, end remedy and visible, It's right by design.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Donald Eastlake to gather comments and find potential implementers for his IPv6 options hiding draft.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Casper to gather feedback on potential use cases for Asus.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> All Interested in RAS to join meeting this coming Thursday.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> All Interested to reach out to Jean Aj for Data Centric Digital Right.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue development and refinement of the discussed drafts and proposals.</li>
<li>Further discussion and collaboration within the respective working groups and research groups.</li>
<li>Solicit feedback and participation from the broader IETF community.</li>
</ul>
