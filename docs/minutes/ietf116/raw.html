<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 31 Mar 2023 03:00</p>
<h1>raw</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The RAW working group meeting covered document status updates, presentations on use cases, mobility, and OAM, and a discussion about the future of the architecture draft and the working group itself. Rick and Eve announced their intention to transition out of their chair positions, with a plan to potentially merge the RAW group back into the DETNET working group. The meeting concluded with decisions on document progression and next steps for the working group's future.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document Status:</strong> The L-Strap has been published as an RFC. The Use Cases draft is awaiting IESG review. The Technologies draft awaits shepherd write-up. The Architecture draft remains a key point of discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Mobility Draft:</strong> Initial feedback suggests interest in the mobility problem, independent of specific solutions. Applicability across multiple lower layers (e.g., WiFi in addition to 5G) was seen as a valuable aspect.</li>
<li><strong>OAM Draft:</strong> The OAM draft is considered stable and ready for working group last call, pending discussion on architectural dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>WG Chairs Transition:</strong> Rick and Eve are transitioning out of their roles as WG chairs. A potential merger with DETNET is being considered.</li>
<li><strong>Architecture Draft:</strong> A joint working group last call with DETNET was proposed to gain broader review and consensus.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial Requirements Draft:</strong> Additional co-authors may be sought to help progress the expired Industrial Requirements draft.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Cases Draft:</strong> Await IESG review and publication.</li>
<li><strong>OAM Draft:</strong> Proceed to working group last call.</li>
<li><strong>Architecture Draft:</strong> Conduct a joint working group last call with DETNET. Eve volunteered to be a shepherd for the joint last call</li>
<li><strong>Industrial Requirements Draft:</strong> Reach out to the original authors and solicit additional co-authors to help progress the draft. Carlos volunteered to help.</li>
<li><strong>Technologies Draft:</strong> Carlos to provide a write-up as shepherd.</li>
<li><strong>Transition to DETNET:</strong> Discussion to be held on the mailing list regarding the process, timeline, and steps for transitioning RAW into DETNET.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chairs of both RAW and DETNET to discuss and coordinate the joint last call for the architecture draft.</li>
<li>Eve to contact the original authors of the industrial requirements document and introduce them to Carlos.</li>
<li>Begin discussion on the mailing list about the transition of RAW into DETNET.</li>
</ul>
