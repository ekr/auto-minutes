## Summary

This meeting covered three main topics: the TVR Requirements document, the ALTO Exposure document, and the TVR Applicability document. The discussion on the Requirements document focused on its readiness for last call, while the discussion on the ALTO Exposure document centered on generalizing it to cover off-path solutions beyond ALTO. The Applicability document discussion revolved around the scope of use cases to be included and the level of detail required for each.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **TVR Requirements:**
    *   The Requirements document is considered mature and ready for last call.
    *   Suggestions to improve the document are welcome, particularly focusing on reducing text and removing duplication.
    *   Dissemination of the draft in other working groups (e.g., OPS, satellite-related groups) was suggested.
*   **ALTO Exposure:**
    *   The draft was adopted in December, and version 01 includes implementation status reporting and open issues.
    *   A key issue is the ALTO-specific nature of the document. A proposal was made to generalize it to "TVR off-path exposure" with ALTO as a specific example.
    *   Discussion on whether a single document can capture commonality of off-path solutions with carve-outs for specific mechanisms.
    *   Consideration of removing the implementation status section for long-term viability of the document.
*   **TVR Applicability:**
    *   The current draft includes two use cases: titled network and dynamic reachability network.
    *   The question of whether these two use cases are sufficient was raised.
    *   A call was made to include all use cases from the TVR use case RFC in the applicability document.
    *   A desire for the document to go into detail about how the YANG models are used, providing concrete examples.
    *   Discussion about the purpose of applicability document is to test the coverage of YANG models against use cases
    *   Discussion on different schedule generation and execution manners impacting the application of the TBI YANG model.
    *   Hardware-based (GPS, PTP) and software-based (NTP, SNTP) time synchronization mechanisms were discussed.
    *   Suggestion to use GNSS instead of GPS for generality.
    *   Importance of the clock synchronization for the control plane.
    *   Schedule database considerations were introduced with the structure including node power, interface, nodes, and links schedule entries.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **TVR Requirements:**
    *   Initiate working group last call on the mailing list.
    *   Young doctor review should go in parallel with last call
*   **ALTO Exposure:**
    *   Rename the document to "TVR off-path exposure" or similar, generalizing it beyond ALTO.
    *   New title will be taken to the mailing list to confirm no strong objections.
*   **TVR Applicability:**
    *   Include all use cases from the TVR use case RFC in the applicability document.
    *   Solicit contributions from contributors to expand the document content.
    *   Optimize operational considerations

## Next Steps

*   **TVR Requirements:** Await feedback from last call and address any remaining issues.
*   **ALTO Exposure:** Prepare a new version of the draft with the generalized scope and title. Implement the changes in version 02
*   **TVR Applicability:** Expand the document to include all use cases, going into detail about the YANG models and their application.
