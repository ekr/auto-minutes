<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 21 Mar 2025 06:00</p>
<h1>srv6ops</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The srv6ops meeting included presentations from Turkcell and China Telecom on their SRV6 deployment experiences. There were also presentations on several drafts, including one focused on SRV6 deployment and operational problems, another on migrating MPLS to SRV6, a third on IPv6 address assignment for SRV6, and finally a presentation from BMWG regarding benchmarking of SRv6 forwarding.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turkcell's SRV6 Deployment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Turkcell is migrating from MPLS to SRV6 for service chaining, traffic engineering, and fast convergence.</li>
<li>They are using a multi-vendor environment and are focused on testing interoperability.</li>
<li>They plan to activate IPv6 on all interfaces of their IP backbone and use IS-ISv6 as the IGP.</li>
<li>They are also testing extending data center capabilities to the edge with SRv6.</li>
<li>The controller strategy may involve multiple vendor-specific controllers and a separate orchestrator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>China Telecom's SRV6 Deployment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>China Telecom has deployed SRv6 in its metro area network (IPMAN) for B2B and B2C services.</li>
<li>They are using option A and option C for inter-AS services.</li>
<li>They are leveraging controllers, Netconf/Yang, and telemetry for network management.</li>
<li>They are allocating IPv6 address blocks based on region and service category.</li>
<li>Current alternate marking concurrency limited to few VIP services and need is to expand the concurrency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Draft: SRv6 Deployment and Operation Problem Summary:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The draft outlines problems encountered in SRv6 deployment, including inter-domain deployment, data plane visualization, address assessment, traffic steering, and protection deployment.</li>
<li>New scenarios covered are SRv6 and non-SRv6 coexistence, SRv6 traversing third-party networks (using IPsec over GRE), and deployment in different network types (data center, campus).</li>
<li>The group needs to ensure the &quot;problems&quot; are framed as operational issues rather than requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Draft: SRv6 Migration from MPLS:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The draft provides guidance on migrating existing MPLS networks to SRv6, including the steps involved in migrating L3VPN MPLS solutions.</li>
<li>The working group should provide feedback on its appropriateness as a separate document and whether the current draft provides sufficient insight.</li>
<li>More illustrations and examples should be added.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Draft: IPv6 Address Assignment for SRv6:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The draft provides guidance on IPv6 address assignment for SRv6, including SRv6 seed block considerations and allocation provisions for P2P, P2MP, Unicast and Multicast traffic.</li>
<li>It details the relationship between the full seed and the compressed seed and how node ID and function ID allocations work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Draft: Using AS Numbers to Structure the SID Space Advertised Between SRV6 Domains</strong>
<ul>
<li>The draft proposes using ASNs to structure the SID space when advertising binding SIDs from one network to another.</li>
<li>It suggests voluntarily, rather than requires, the use of ASNs.</li>
<li>It should change the term domain from inter-domain to inter-provider.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Draft: Benchmarking Methodology for Segment Routing Enabled Devices</strong>
<ul>
<li>The draft presents a methodology for benchmarking packet forwarding capabilities of segment routing enabled devices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>SRv6 Deployment and Operation Problem Summary Draft:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Authors to revise the draft to ensure the listed items are framed as operational problems rather than requirements.</li>
<li>A reviewer will work with authors to update the document, and then the working group will be asked again for adoption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SRv6 Migration from MPLS Draft:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Authors should add more meat in the draft including examples and what the problems or issues may be with migration and look out for these issues.</li>
<li>Working group members interested in contributing should contact the authors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors of the drafts presented should incorporate the feedback received during the meeting.</li>
<li>The working group will discuss the adoption of the revised drafts on the mailing list.</li>
</ul>
