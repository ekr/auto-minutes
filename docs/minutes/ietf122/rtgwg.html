<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 20 Mar 2025 02:30</p>
<h1>rtgwg</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This RTGWG session covered a variety of topics including updates on existing drafts, discussions on new proposals related to routing in various environments, and explorations of emerging technologies like AI for network operations. Key discussions revolved around the applicability and potential standardization efforts within the IETF for these areas.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>SD1 Related Technologies:</strong> The working group reviewed drafts related to SD1, specifically focusing on gaps in enterprise connectivity to the cloud and multi-segment SD1 architectures. The discussion emphasized the need for clarity on the scope and intended audience of the SD1 framework document.</li>
<li><strong>IPV6 Neighbor Discovery Young Model:</strong>  A discussion took place around naming and scope for the IPv6 neighbor discovery YANG model. There was debate on whether to include all ND functions or focus specifically on address resolution and if missing counters should be added.</li>
<li><strong>Fast Failure Reduction with VRRP:</strong> The working group discussed incorporating BFD for faster failure detection and recovery in VRRP.  Alternatives like seamless BFD were suggested to reduce VRRP state and simplify procedures.</li>
<li><strong>SR Policy Programming RPC:</strong> The potential for an RPC mechanism for SR policy programming was presented.  Discussion focused on the necessity of a new RPC given existing mechanisms, the level of granularity (policy vs. candidate path), and motivation relative to other options (e.g. PCAP, BGP-LS). Existing specifications like RFC 7424 were mentioned as possible starting points.</li>
<li><strong>Routing in Computing Cluster Networks:</strong> A draft discussing routing requirements in computing cluster networks was reviewed. Discussion centered on the purpose of the draft (informational vs. protocol specification) and whether it should focus on specifying missing elements, echoing a similar data center effort in the past.</li>
<li><strong>Routing in Satellite Networks:</strong> The working group reviewed a draft regarding routing in satellite networks. Discussion focused on the scope of applicability with 5/6G standards, and whether routing challenges were novel or generic cases of mobile network and limited link capacity topology. Also, if existing solutions using STN/PSEP can be applied.</li>
<li><strong>IGP Color Awareness Shortcut Routing:</strong> The presentation centered on the IGP Color Awareness shortcut routine. Questions were asked about the usefulness of this solution and why a new RFC was needed given the function already exists.</li>
<li><strong>AI for Network Operations:</strong>  The group discussed the role of AI in network operations, particularly concerning IETF standardization. There was a consensus that the core issue might be data correlation rather than new NMBI/CSBI. Suggestions were made to focus efforts within NMORG or address related topics by exploring digital twins within NMRG or standards by discussing related studies with ETSI or ITU.</li>
<li><strong>Generalized IPV6 Channel:</strong> Discussions explored new deployment cases and challenges in using this technology.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>SD1 Framework:</strong> Linda to request another round of direct reviews for the main SD1 framework draft.</li>
<li><strong>IPV6 Neighbor Discovery Young Model:</strong> Authors to analyze RFC 4861/4862 to determine missing components, consider renaming the module to V6 Neighbor Discovery, and continue the discussion on the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Fast Failure Reduction with VRRP:</strong> Chairs to work with authors to coordinate with other BFD-related work, including seamless BFD. Authors to consider using seamless BFD.</li>
<li><strong>SR Policy Programming RPC:</strong> Zafar to include a comparison table in the document, comparing the new proposal to existing solutions. Consider ephemeral semantics from RFC 7424.</li>
<li><strong>AI for Network Operations:</strong> Follow up by going to NMRG.</li>
<li><strong>Generalized IPV6 Channel:</strong> Continue the discussion on the mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to revise drafts based on feedback received during the session.</li>
<li>Continue discussions on mailing lists to further refine requirements and solutions.</li>
<li>Coordinate efforts across working groups (e.g., BFD-related drafts).</li>
<li>Explore potential collaboration with other standards bodies (e.g., ITU, ETSI).</li>
</ul>
