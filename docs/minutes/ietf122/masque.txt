## Summary
The MASQUE working group meeting at IETF 122 covered the status of four adopted documents: CONNECT-TO-B-BIND, Quick Aware Proxying in HTTP, CONNECT-ETHERNET, and DNS Configuration for Proxying IP in HTTP. The meeting also included a discussion on a new document proposal: "Mask Proxy," an informational document aiming to clarify the use and application of MASQUE technologies. The main focus was on determining the best venue for the "Mask Proxy" document given its applicability and potential research aspects.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **CONNECT-TO-B-BIND:**
    *   Clarifications added regarding context reuse to avoid ambiguity.
    *   Working group last call to be initiated, contingent on multiple interoperable implementations.
*   **Quick Aware Proxying in HTTP:**
    *   Updates included disabling forwarding mode and explicit opt-in for port sharing via a new header.
    *   Discussion on potential server misbehavior with port sharing and the interaction with Scone.
    *   Client connection ID registration with the proxy before receiving packets was clarified.
    *   Further review and resolution of open issues are needed before last call.
*   **CONNECT-ETHERNET:**
    *   Updates included dropping frames if undeliverable and congestion control considerations.
    *   Working group last call to be initiated after an IETF coordination list review.
    *   An MTU-related issue will be raised.
*   **DNS Configuration for Proxying IP in HTTP:**
    *   Clarified applicability to site-to-site use cases.
    *   Discussion on whether the DNS request capsule is necessary, considering the potential for unsolicited DNS assign.
*   **Mask Proxy (Informational Document):**
    *   David Skinazi presented the document outlining MASQUE's privacy properties and its relation to other technologies.
    *   Discussion on the appropriate venue for publishing the document (MASQUE WG, PRG, AD-sponsored).
    *   Suggestions were made to split the document or create a companion to detail both privacy and technical aspects.
    *   Partitioning as a key property was discussed.
    *   Ben Strong raised the issue that defining mask as an umbrella is difficult because it is not an interoperable technical element
    *   The idea of a retrospective document with the PAN-RG was explored

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **CONNECT-TO-B-BIND:** Initiate working group last call, contingent on interoperability testing.
*   **CONNECT-ETHERNET:** Initiate working group last call after IETF coordination list review. Craig Taylor to file an issue on MTU.
*   **DNS Configuration for Proxying IP in HTTP:** Ben Strong to file an issue regarding the necessity of the DNS request capsule.
*   **Mask Proxy:**
    *   Chairs to discuss the charter situation with the responsible AD.
    *   Chairs to contact chairs of PRG and IRTF to determine interest in hosting/sponsoring the document.
    *   David Skinazi to update the document based on discussion feedback.
    *   Explore potential splitting the document into multiple ones

## Next Steps

*   Initiate working group last calls for CONNECT-TO-B-BIND and CONNECT-ETHERNET after necessary conditions are met.
*   Address pending issues on Quick Aware Proxying in HTTP.
*   Update DNS Configuration for Proxying IP in HTTP based on discussion.
*   Chairs and authors to coordinate and determine the next steps and best venue for the "Mask Proxy" document.
