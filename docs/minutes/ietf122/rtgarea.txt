## Summary

The Routing Area (rtgarea) open meeting included updates from the Routing Directorate, discussions on improving document quality, an overview of IAB activities, and a presentation on control plane protocols over QUIC. The meeting also covered working group assignments.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Routing Directorate Report:** The report highlighted the number of reviews completed by the Routing Directorate, the quality of routing area drafts and non-routing area drafts, and the importance of keeping reviewer skills and interests up-to-date.
*   **Improving Document Quality:** Focus on spell check, grammar, readability before technical review. Also, the lens of the implementer, the person who is going to code it up and from a view of an operator who is going to deploy and operate it. Cross-working group collaboration and early reviews are critical. Routing Directorate last call review on behalf of the AD
*   **IAB Activities:** Discussed IAB's role in long-term technical direction, architectural oversight, and collaboration with IESG and ISOC. Highlighted workshops and technical programs as avenues for in-depth discussions and problem-solving. Requested input from the community to identify potential workshop topics or architectural concerns.
*   **Control Plane Protocols over QUIC:** Explored the potential benefits and challenges of using QUIC for control plane protocols. Addressed topics of speed, authentication, streams, session resumption, implementation difficulties, and debugging. Need for standards API.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **ADs to consider routing directorate reviews for more documents:** The ADs will look into how to better encourage other areas to request reviews from the routing directorate.
*   **Routing Directorate to gather feedback on experience:** The Routing Directorate will gather feedback on how to improve assignment processes and feedback delivery.
*   **Routing Directorate Reviewer process change:** A new process is being implemented for Routing Directorate reviews, where a re-review is done by the original reviewer after comments have been addressed, and the result of the second review is captured in Datatracker.

## Next Steps

*   Explore a side meeting or BOF (Birds of a Feather) session to further discuss control plane protocols over QUIC.
