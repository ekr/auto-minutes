# moq

## Summary

This session of the moq working group covered updates to the moq-transport draft, a proposal for adding a publish method and related extensions, and a presentation on moq Q-Log. The key discussion revolved around the publish proposal, wildcard subscriptions, and the need for buffering in implementations.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **moq-transport draft updates:** Ian summarized the changes since IETF-121, focusing on the reorganization of messages and clarification of existing mechanisms.
*   **Publish proposal:** Ian presented a proposal to add a `publish` method, analogous to `subscribe` but initiated by the publisher. This aims to improve video conferencing and video ingestion use cases.
*   **Track Identifier Management:** A related proposal was to replace track alias with a publisher ID and track identifier to improve ambiguity and enable either peer to initiate a subscription.
*   **Wildcard Subscriptions:** Ian described a proposal to allow subscribing to all active tracks in a namespace, which builds upon long-standing feature requests.
*   **Buffering:** The need for buffering at the subscriber was discussed in the context of potential reordering of messages and loss. This led to a debate on whether to require buffering or to introduce an alias acknowledgment mechanism (`alias ACK`).
*   **Relay Behavior:** Colin presented slides detailing how these proposals could impact relay behavior in various scenarios.  The state maintained by relays was discussed.
*   **Q-Log:** Lucas presented on the use of Q-Log for moq, showing the creation of a moq-specific schema and example tooling.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Publish and Track ID Proposal (Ian & Colin):** The working group agreed (with some skepticism) that Ian and Colin should create a PR for the publish method, track ID changes, and a separate PR for wildcard subscriptions.
*   **Address Relay Behavior:** Text should be written from the perspective of what state is maintained at the relays regarding the new proposals.
*   **Announce Track Issue:** Confirm an existing open issue or create one if it does not yet exist to address Announce Track (per Victor).
*   **Alias ACK (Alan):** Alan will defer writing a PR for the alias ACK mechanism, pending further evaluation of the publish proposal.
*   **Moq Q-Log:**  Interested parties should examine the draft to potentially adopt at a future meeting.

## Next Steps

*   Ian and Colin will develop PRs for the publish method, track ID changes, and wildcard subscriptions.
*   The working group will review and provide feedback on these PRs.
*   The working group will further discuss and potentially adopt a Q-Log schema for moq.
