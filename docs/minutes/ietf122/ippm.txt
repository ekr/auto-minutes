## Summary
The IPPM working group meeting in Bangkok covered a range of topics including updates on existing working group documents, proposed new work, and lightning talks.  Key discussions centered around integrity protection for IOM, asymmetric packet extension for STAMP, and quality outcome metrics.  The group also discussed potential new work areas, including aggregation trace options for IOM, and leveraging precision availability metrics in PCE path computation. Several documents are nearing working group last call, prompting calls for increased engagement and feedback from the community.  Tommy has stepped down as IPPM co-chair after this meeting, with Thomas taking over.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IOM Integrity Protection:**  A trade-off solution was proposed using an IANA registry for header fields included in integrity protection, allowing for updates as new fields are added. Concern was raised about the algorithm used.
*   **Asymmetric Packet Extension for STAMP:**  The draft is ready for working group last call. Discussions focused on clarification of expected behavior of session sender and security considerations in multicast environments.
*   **STAMP Extension for Reflecting Packet Headers:** Discussion on whether to split the draft into separate IPV6 and MPLS data plane extensions due to uncertainty in the MPLS working group concerning MNA.
*   **Quality Outcome:**  Simulation studies were presented focusing on determining best engineering practices for designing a system around quality of outcome. The necessity for application-level testing to correlate network-based scores with user experience was highlighted. The group considered whether to publish this as experimental or informational RFC.
*   **Working Responsiveness Metric:** Continued request for input from vendors on the usefulness of RPM (Rantrips per minute) as a predictor of real-world behavior. The presenter highlighted source buffer management as a significant issue.
*   **Alternate Marking Deployment:**  The draft is considered stable and ready for working group last call.
*   **Alternate Marking YANG Data Model:** The draft is considered stable and based on same structure as IOM Yang Data model.
*   **BCN Traversal Measurement Using STAMP:** A new TLV was proposed. Transport area concerns were raised around setting ECN values to anything but zero. Reach out to TSVWG for alignment.
*   **IOM Integrity Protection YANG Data Model:** Consider working group adoption for the YANG model to progress in parallel to the IOM integrity document. Suggestion to add "if-feature" statements to the leaves.
*   **Hop-by-Hop Measurements with Active Tools:** The group considers the draft for adoption. The group is to consider whether to split into separate IPV6 and MPLS data plane extensions.
*   **On-Path Telemetry YANG Data Model:** Discussion about combining alternate marking and IOM telemetry data into a single YANG model. 
*   **Aggregation Trace Option for IOM:** New IOM option that allows to aggregate data during traversal.
*   **Leveraging Precision Availability Metrics in PCE:** Present an idea where a new object in PC called precision metric would be used. 
*   **IOM Characterization Terminology:** Document has stalled in ops AWG, need to engage IPPM.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IOM Integrity Protection:** Proceed with the trade-off solution using an IANA registry for header fields, soliciting further feedback on the mailing list.
*   **Asymmetric Packet Extension for STAMP:**  Consider for working group last call.
*   **STAMP Extension for Reflecting Packet Headers:**  Decision on whether to split IPV6 and MPLS sections will be deferred pending further discussion.
*   **Quality Outcome:** Add security considerations to the document. Consider the classification of the document as experimental versus informational.
*   **Working Responsiveness Metric:** Update the draft by April 24th.
*   **BCN Traversal Measurement Using STAMP:** Coordinate with the transport area/TSVWG regarding ECN concerns before adoption.
*   **IOM Integrity Protection YANG Data Model:**  Consider for working group adoption.
*   **Hop-by-Hop Measurements with Active Tools:** The group is to consider whether to split into separate IPV6 and MPLS data plane extensions.
*   **On-Path Telemetry YANG Data Model:** Revise model for on-path telemetry to combine IOM and alternate marketing.
*   **IOM Characterization Terminology:** Send the document to the IPPM mailing list to gauge interest.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to revise documents based on feedback received.
*   Chairs to schedule working group last calls and adoption calls based on document stability and feedback.
*   Increase community engagement in reviewing and providing feedback on existing and proposed documents.
*   Explore outreach opportunities to application development communities to improve feedback loop.
*   Coordinate with TSVWG regarding ECN concerns related to STAMP extensions.
