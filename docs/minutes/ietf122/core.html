<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 18 Mar 2025 02:30</p>
<h1>core</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This session of the core working group at IETF 122 covered a wide range of topics, including document status updates, clarifications, conditional attributes, DNS over CoAP, PubSub, transport indication, multicast notifications, key updates, and CoAP in space.  Significant progress was reported on several documents moving towards publication.  Discussions focused on technical details, outstanding issues, and future directions for the working group.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corrections and Clarifications Document (Korklar):</strong> Discussed including &quot;gaps&quot; (unsatisfactory semantics in existing specifications) in the Korklar document alongside incorrect and incomplete cases.  Decision made to proceed with adding gaps to the document.</li>
<li><strong>Kau-Conf:</strong> Discussed the status of YANG model SID assignment. Currently generating SIDs for all YANG models in RFCs and will then allocate SID ranges for each. A fork of fog of Piang tool is available.</li>
<li><strong>HRF (Constrained Resource Identifiers):</strong> Draft-20 has addressed working group last call comments. Discussion on whether to submit to IESG now or conduct a second working group last call. Will follow up with the shepherd (Thomas) before proceeding.</li>
<li><strong>Conditional Attributes for CoAP Observe:</strong> Open issues related to handling complex data structures and mixing query parameters. Consideration of limiting support to scalar/boolean values.</li>
<li><strong>DNS over CoAP Bundle:</strong> Two documents, dns-over-coap and coap-dtls-clpn, are ready to proceed to the shepherd write-up. Cordial (DNS over CoAP with OSCAR) needs sharpening and reviews.</li>
<li><strong>PubSub for CoAP:</strong>  Review of recent updates, including IANA clarifications and addressing shepherd write-up issues.  Discussion on RFC and Ops attribute elision. The decision was to elide the resource type.</li>
<li><strong>Transport Indication:</strong>  Discussion of the document's goals: advertising transport capabilities and establishing a process for new CoAP transports.  Need for reviews, with a focus on the question of whether the literal part needs to be present in this document or whether a sketch is sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Observe Multicast Notifications:</strong>  Discussion of forbidden redirections, a point of time parameter for terminating group observations, and reverse proxy setup.  Suggestion to separate the specification from examples to improve accessibility. The reverse proxy setup may be moved to another document as it's not normative.</li>
<li><strong>Kudos (Key Update for OSCORE):</strong> Update on major redesign with a more flexible and simpler approach based on nances. Updates for aligning the ID Update and Key Usage Limit documents.</li>
<li><strong>CoAP over Bundle Protocol and CoAP in Space:</strong> Updates on new sections on proxying and message aggregation. In scenarios with CoAP proxies, BPSEC cannot ensure the protection of application layer data between a CoAP client and the CoAP origin server (OSCORE should be used). Also, there is a request for IANA to add the payload length option to the co-option numbers registry.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Korklar:</strong> Add &quot;gaps&quot; to the document, describing unsatisfactory semantics in existing specifications.</li>
<li><strong>HRF:</strong> Follow up with shepherd Thomas regarding the necessity of another working group last call.</li>
<li><strong>Conditional Attributes:</strong> Bill will update the document based on discussion, including potential limitations on supporting complex data structures.</li>
<li><strong>DNS over CoAP Bundle:</strong> Complete shepherd write-ups for dns-over-coap and coap-dtls-clpn.</li>
<li><strong>PubSub for CoAP:</strong>  Jaime will update the editor copy in GitHub with the changes, submit version 19, and then start the shepherd write-up.</li>
<li><strong>Transport Indication:</strong>  Authors to address the feedback regarding how literals are handled. Focus review efforts on this document.</li>
<li><strong>Observe Multicast Notifications:</strong>  Explore separating the specification from examples, potentially moving proxy-related content to a separate informational document.</li>
<li><strong>Kudos:</strong> Align related documents on ID Update and Key Usage Limits with the new kudos state machine design.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to implement changes based on feedback.</li>
<li>Shepherds to continue shepherding documents towards publication.</li>
<li>Working group to provide reviews on outstanding drafts.</li>
<li>Coordinate with other working groups (e.g., T2TRG, tip-top) where applicable.</li>
</ul>
