<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 16 Mar 2025 11:00</p>
<h1>Hot RFC Lightning Talks</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This session featured a series of lightning talks on various hot topics of interest to the IETF community, including DNS for identity, confidential computing, AI network security, LLM-assisted network management, source buffer management, object-based media, zero-trust network access, confidential computing limitations, diagramming RFCs, and trust contexts in attested TLS environments. The speakers presented their work, identified challenges, and sought collaboration with other experts.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>DNS for Identity (Philip Hallam-Baker):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Proposed using DNS service discovery and OAuth 2 for identity management.</li>
<li>Suggested that DNS can scale for identity purposes, despite previous concerns.</li>
<li>Mentioned a draft &quot;Helen Baker any&quot; and a prototype website mplace2.social using this technology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Leaky Computing and Confidential Computing (Manu Fontaine):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussed the problem of information leakage with non-cryptographic identifiers.</li>
<li>Proposed STEM identifiers (random 256-bit identifiers/symmetric keys) for process-level information isolation.</li>
<li>Presented a side meeting on Tuesday to discuss the universal name system and Universal Certificate Authority (UCA).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Enabling Data Security Processing for AI (Lonely):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Highlighted the need for data processing security in AI-driven telecom networks.</li>
<li>Introduced homomorphic encryption as a potential solution for privacy-preserving AI inference and training.</li>
<li>Announced a side meeting on Tuesday to discuss trust and privacy issues in data usage and processing for AI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>LLM Assisted Network Management with Human Loop (Ming Zheing):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Presented a draft on using Large Language Models (LLMs) for network management while keeping a human operator in the loop.</li>
<li>Described a framework with components including telemetry models and large decision models, including configuration validation and access control modules.</li>
<li>Sought collaborators for developing this framework.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Source Buffer Management (Dan):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Explained the problem of excessive source buffering causing latency issues.</li>
<li>Proposed a TCP &quot;not sent low watermark&quot; socket option to minimize excess buffering.</li>
<li>Highlighted the importance of fixing source buffer bloat to achieve low latency and responsive performance.</li>
<li>Reference to a draft and mailing list (spm@ietf.org).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Object-Based Media (Dan):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussed moving away from linear distribution of television to object-based media.</li>
<li>Identified scaling challenges for serving object-based media to hundreds of thousands of users.</li>
<li>Exploring Computer-Aware Traffic Steering (CAPS) and application content above it, as well as video media distribution protocols such as Quick.</li>
<li>Sought collaboration with operators working on similar projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Zero Trust Network Access for Network Clouds (Wadashih):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Presented a draft on zero-trust network access for interfaces between cloud and network in telecom clouds.</li>
<li>Proposed integrating zero-trust principles with a YANG data model.</li>
<li>Mentioned a side meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss use cases and applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Confidential Computing Limitations (Osama):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Critiqued confidential computing, claiming attestation key exfiltration breaks the entire security model.</li>
<li>Questioned how the identity and long-term key get into the VM.</li>
<li>Sought collaborators in TLS, remote attestation, formal methods, and confidential computing.</li>
<li>Several side meetings were proposed to discuss the identified attacks and formalization of the results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Diagramming RFCs (name unclear):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Raised the issue of understanding RFCs and their impact across different layers.</li>
<li>Proposed a framework for diagramming documents to better understand their relationships to the overall infrastructure stack.</li>
<li>Sought collaborators to discuss the concept and potential solutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Exploring Trust Contexts in Attested TLS Environments (Pavel Nikonorov):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussed trust models and assessment of trustworthiness in confidential workloads.</li>
<li>Proposed a trust anchor specification or a registry for audited software and configuration files.</li>
<li>Seeks collaborators that have knowledge in formal security analysis, trust models and relevant specification.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Attendees interested in specific topics (DNS for identity, confidential computing, AI network security, LLM-assisted network management, source buffer management, object-based media, zero-trust network access, diagramming RFCs, and trust contexts in attested TLS environments) should contact the speakers directly to collaborate.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Attendees were encouraged to review the slides available on the Datatracker.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Attendees should attend the side meetings mentioned by the speakers to further discuss the topics.</li>
<li>Follow-up discussions may occur on the mailing lists provided (e.g., spm@ietf.org for source buffer management).</li>
<li>Independent submissions and working group adoption may be considered based on community interest.</li>
</ul>
