## Summary

The GAIA session at IETF 122 in Bangkok featured presentations on air pollution monitoring in Thailand and China, and a connectivity solution using LoRa Mesh networks. Key discussions revolved around the accuracy of low-cost sensors, the need for customized mitigation strategies for vulnerable populations, and the potential standardization of LoRa Mesh network protocols. Unfortunately, the fourth speaker was unable to attend due to technical difficulties.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Air Pollution Monitoring:**
    *   Addisorne presented on a project measuring PM2.5 exposure among frontline workers (e.g., motorcycle riders) in Bangkok and Shanghai.
    *   Data showed that vulnerable groups experience significantly higher pollution exposure compared to general air quality data.
    *   The discussion covered sources of pollution (local vs. regional burns), and the challenges of implementing mitigation strategies that might impact livelihoods.
    *   Calibration of low-cost sensors against standard stations was discussed.
    *   The idea of targeting corporations contributing to pollution with IOT sensors was proposed
*   **LoRa Mesh Networks:**
    *   Felix presented on LoRa Mesh networks as a low-cost, easily deployable connectivity solution.
    *   Limitations include low data rates and lack of standardization.
    *   The discussion covered the use cases, multi-hop capabilities, duty cycle management, applications on campus, and the potential integration with internet services.
    *   Standardization was discussed in the context of the relationship to Meshtastic, and potential venues for standardization, including the IETF (thing-to-thing research group).

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:**  Curtis to connect Felix with the IETF thing-to-thing research group to explore potential standardization of LoRa Mesh network protocols.

## Next Steps

*   The next GAIA session will be held in Madrid.
*   The presentation on community fiber networks in Java, originally scheduled for this session, will be rescheduled for Madrid.
