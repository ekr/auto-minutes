## Summary

The SIDROPS meeting covered a range of topics, including updates on the NRO RPKI program, ASPA verification examples, an enhanced RPKI repository proposal, Yang data models for RPKI-to-Router protocol, ASPA-based egress verification, RPKI terminology, an ARDAP extension for RPKI registration data, source address validation using RPKI, forwarding commitments for routing intents, and RPKI Relying Party deployment considerations. Several presentations sparked lively discussions, particularly regarding the necessity and practicality of certain proposals.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **NRO RPKI Program:** Updates on transparency, security, and user experience consistency improvements were presented.
*   **ASPA Verification Examples:** Verification examples for the ASPA and unit tests were presented, multiple implementers have reported success running unit tests against implementations.
*   **Enhanced RPKI Repository:** A proposal for an enhanced and independent RPKI repository was discussed, with concerns raised about whether it addresses a real problem and aligns with existing resource holder flexibility.
*   **Yang Data Model:** Discussion on Yang data model for RPKI-to-Router, with plans for adoption requests after revisions. AFI agnosticism was highlighted as a concern.
*   **ASPA Egress Verification:** A draft on ASPA-based AS path verification for BGP export was presented, but met with skepticism regarding its practicality and usefulness compared to existing methods like OTC.
*   **RPKI Terminology:** An effort to standardize RPKI terminology was introduced, with encouragement for the initiative and suggestions for focusing on objects and entities.
*   **ARDAP Extension:** Discussion of an ARDAP extension for RPKI registration data, with considerations for security, data distribution, and integration with existing RPKI infrastructure.
*   **Source Address Validation (SAV):** A proposal for source address validation (SAV) using RPKI was presented, facing criticism regarding its complexity and unclear value proposition.
*   **Forwarding Commitments (FC):** A proposal for forwarding commitments (FC) to describe routing intents was discussed, with concerns raised about complexity and overhead.
*   **RP Relying Party Deployment:** Experiences with RPKI Relying Party deployment were shared, with a call for more discussion on RP software and deployment.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **ASPA Verification Draft:** Version 21 has been uploaded, Version 22 will be uploaded.
*   **Yang Data Model:** Presenter to update the mailing list when the document is ready for adoption.
*   **ASPA Egress Verification:**  Presenter to consider feedback and address concerns raised during discussion.
*   **RPKI Terminology:** The group is planning a call for adoption in the near future.
*   **ARDAP Extension:** Presenter to address concerns about data distribution and scalability and incorporate suggested improvements.

## Next Steps

*   The group is encouraged to review the discussed drafts and provide feedback on the mailing list.
*   Presenters are encouraged to consider the feedback received and revise their proposals accordingly.
*   The group will discuss adoption of the RPKI Terminology draft after a call for adoption request on the list.
