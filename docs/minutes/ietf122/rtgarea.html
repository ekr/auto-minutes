<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 19 Mar 2025 08:30</p>
<h1>rtgarea</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Routing Area (rtgarea) open meeting included updates from the Routing Directorate, discussions on improving document quality, an overview of IAB activities, and a presentation on control plane protocols over QUIC. The meeting also covered working group assignments.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Routing Directorate Report:</strong> The report highlighted the number of reviews completed by the Routing Directorate, the quality of routing area drafts and non-routing area drafts, and the importance of keeping reviewer skills and interests up-to-date.</li>
<li><strong>Improving Document Quality:</strong> Focus on spell check, grammar, readability before technical review. Also, the lens of the implementer, the person who is going to code it up and from a view of an operator who is going to deploy and operate it. Cross-working group collaboration and early reviews are critical. Routing Directorate last call review on behalf of the AD</li>
<li><strong>IAB Activities:</strong> Discussed IAB's role in long-term technical direction, architectural oversight, and collaboration with IESG and ISOC. Highlighted workshops and technical programs as avenues for in-depth discussions and problem-solving. Requested input from the community to identify potential workshop topics or architectural concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Control Plane Protocols over QUIC:</strong> Explored the potential benefits and challenges of using QUIC for control plane protocols. Addressed topics of speed, authentication, streams, session resumption, implementation difficulties, and debugging. Need for standards API.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>ADs to consider routing directorate reviews for more documents:</strong> The ADs will look into how to better encourage other areas to request reviews from the routing directorate.</li>
<li><strong>Routing Directorate to gather feedback on experience:</strong> The Routing Directorate will gather feedback on how to improve assignment processes and feedback delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Routing Directorate Reviewer process change:</strong> A new process is being implemented for Routing Directorate reviews, where a re-review is done by the original reviewer after comments have been addressed, and the result of the second review is captured in Datatracker.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Explore a side meeting or BOF (Birds of a Feather) session to further discuss control plane protocols over QUIC.</li>
</ul>
