## Summary

The avtcore meeting at IETF 122 covered a wide range of topics, including draft statuses, updates on adopted drafts, and presentations on new proposals. Key discussions revolved around RTP/QUIC, haptics, volumetric media, and encryption. Decisions were made regarding working group last calls for several drafts, and action items were assigned to the chairs and draft authors.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Draft Status:** Discussion on RFC publication of RTP payload registries and the remaining issues on other drafts.
*   **Green Metadata and Further Draft:**  Concerns raised about lack of feedback from the RTP side of Green Metadata.  Discussion about issues surrounding SDP negotiation for the further draft, a second working group last call requested.
*   **S-Frame:**  Interest expressed in S-Frame for end-to-end encryption in WebRTC. The document should be put in park status temporarily until folks can determine whether its use is necessary for WebRTC.
*   **RTP/QUIC:** Interrupt testing updates with new implementations being tested. SDP work is ongoing, and a decision was made to proceed with an initial working group last call witholding pub req.
*   **SDP for RoQ:** Comments and concerns about the complexity of interaction between RoQ and Bundle and the need for peer-to-peer RoQ setup. Discussion about flow ID.
*   **Haptics:** Draft is considered ready for a working group last call after incorporating review comments.
*   **VDMC:** Updates based on feedback from MPEG specifications, with a focus on VDMC grouping and SDP parameters. More group review is desired before group adoption.
*   **APB:** Codec specification updates, including the introduction of two-layer frames. Discussions on the marker bit usage and fragment counter.
*   **Encryption Detection:** Presentation on a method for detecting encoding corruption using RTP header extensions.
*   **Frame Decoded Feedback:** Presentation on a proposal for providing feedback on decoded frames to allow senders to reason about the state of reference buffers.
*   **Geometry-Based Point-Cloud Compression:** Update on the payload format for GPCC, focusing on the length field in aggregation units.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **S-Frame:** Put the S-Frame document in park status, and document the reasoning on the mailing list.
*   **RTP/QUIC:** Proceed with an initial working group last call.
*   **SDP for RoQ:** Spencer and Victor will respond to a few comments from Harold and Jonathan in the next version of the draft.
*   **Haptics:** Proceed with a working group last call.
*   **Chairs:**
    *   Share meeting notes in the session notes in the Datatracker.
    *   Schedule an interim meeting in May or June.

## Next Steps

*   Draft authors to address feedback and prepare updated versions.
*   Working group to review drafts under last call and provide comments.
*   Chairs to schedule an interim meeting.
