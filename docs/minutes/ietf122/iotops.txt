# iotops

## Summary

This meeting focused primarily on the rechartering proposal for the IoT Operations (iotops) working group. Discussions included clarifications on the scope of work, particularly regarding Mud (Manufacturer Usage Description) solutions and software/firmware update solutions. The group also discussed the status of existing documents, specifically the "Comparison of CoAP Security Protocols" document and the 7228bis terminology document.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Rechartering Proposal:**
    *   Discussion on changes in the rechartering proposal, including updated text for allowing standards track and BCP documents.
    *   Clarification on the iotops group's role as both a working group and a dispatch point for IoT operational issues.
    *   Refinement of the specific standard track BCP documents the group will work on, with a focus on Mud solutions and software/firmware update solutions.
    *   Agreement that the terminology document ("7228bis") should be included in the scope.
    *   Action item: Review the scope of software/firmware updates with the SUIT working group to ensure no overlap.
    *   Request from AD for at least two milestones proposal for upcoming chartered work.
*   **Comparison of CoAP Security Protocols Document:**
    *   The document is considered complete by the authors, pending the status of CTLS (Constrained TLS).
    *   CTLS is currently an expired draft in the TLS working group.
    *   The reference to CTLS is informational.
    *   Decision: The iotops chairs will contact the TLS working group chairs and potentially higher IETF leadership to inquire about the status of CTLS.
    *   Discussion on whether to publish the document even if CTLS does not move forward. General agreement to be pragmatic and move the document forward.
*   **7228bis Terminology Document:**
    *   The document is considered good enough by some reviewers, with no further additions suggested.
    *   Outstanding review feedback from one reviewer needs to be incorporated.
    *   Author(s) are potentially overloaded, and help is needed to operationalize the review feedback.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** iotops chairs will contact TLS working group chairs and potentially higher IETF leadership regarding the status of CTLS.
*   **Action Item:** Authors of the rechartering proposal to consult with the SUIT working group chairs regarding the scope of software/firmware update solutions.
*   **Action Item:** Authors of the rechartering proposal to add at least two milestones proposal for upcoming chartered work.
*   **Action Item:** The authors of 7228bis incorporate the outstanding review feedback. Chairs will assist in finding help, if required.

## Next Steps

*   Finalize the rechartering proposal after addressing the action items.
*   Process the rechartering proposal.
*   Progress the "Comparison of CoAP Security Protocols" document, considering the status of CTLS.
*   Progress the 7228bis terminology document.
