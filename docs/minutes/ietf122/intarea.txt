## Summary

The intarea meeting covered a wide range of topics, including updates on existing drafts, new proposals related to ICMP, multicast, and network mapping, and a discussion about packet reordering.  Key highlights included the introduction of the Tip Top working group focused on IP in space, updates on proxy configuration discovery, and proposals for extending ICMP functionality. Several drafts are nearing working group last call.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Tip Top Working Group (IP in Space):** Introduction of the new working group addressing the challenges of running IP networks in space, focusing on adapting IP to handle disruptions, significant delays, and resource constraints.
*   **Communicating Proxy Configuration:** Update on the draft defining a JSON format for proxy configurations, including the introduction of mandatory keys for extensibility and refinements to match/exclude criteria. Focus on proprietary keys with organization namespaces.
*   **ICMP Extensions for Node Identification:** Discussion of a draft proposing an ICMP extension for reporting node identification information in error messages, useful in scenarios where nodes lack globally unique addresses. The proposal advocates for a simple approach with extensions for additional data.
*   **RC8335 BIS Clarification:** The existing draft requires clarification to address interoperability issues in implementations, especially regarding the handling of extensions.
*   **ICMP Extension Header Length Field:** Proposal to add a length attribute to the ICMP extension header, allowing for more flexible extension handling.
*   **Multicast Application Port:** Proposal to assign a dedicated UDP port for multicast applications, aiming to reduce port exhaustion in the IANA registry. The proposal requires conformant hosts to set the `SO_REUSEADDR` flag.
*   **IPv4 Routes with IPv6 Next Hop:** Discussion of the technique of using IPv6 next hops for IPv4 routes, deployed in various environments, its advantages in IPv6 adoption, and addressing ICMP-related issues.
*   **Safer Limited Domains:** Presentation of a draft aimed at preventing limited domain protocols from causing harm to outside networks, exploring mechanisms like ether types, TTL/hop limits, address scoping, and scoped multicast addresses.
*   **EVN6 Mapping:** Update on a draft that proposes a mapping of Ethernet virtual networks to IPv6 for frame transformation, with discussion of its architecture and address mapping schemes.
*   **Enhancing ICMP Error Message Authentication:** Proposal for a challenge-response mechanism to enhance the security of ICMP error messages against forging attacks. Concerns were raised about potential amplification and state management.
*   **Packet Reordering:** Discussion on resequencing concerns focusing on when IP stacks support RAC. Consideration as to whether such ordering should occur at layer two given that the benefits of TCP are not shared by the higher layer.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Draft IETF Interior Tunnels:** Working group last call to be initiated.
*   **Multicast Application Port:**  Authors to contact the IANA Ports Team and potentially adding a question about mutlicast-based ports when reserving a port in IANA.
*   **IPv4 Routes with IPv6 Next Hop:** Working Group Adoption requested.
*   **Safer Limited Domains:** Working Group Adoption requested.

## Next Steps

*   Working group last calls for relevant drafts.
*   Continued discussion and refinement of drafts on the mailing list.
*   Address open issues and concerns raised during the meeting.
*   Clarify the scope and target audience for the packet reordering draft.
