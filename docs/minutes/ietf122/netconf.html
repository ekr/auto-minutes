<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 18 Mar 2025 06:00</p>
<h1>netconf</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The NETCONF working group session covered a variety of topics, including updates on drafts related to NETCONF over Quick, list pagination, augmented by addition to the YANG library, external transaction ID for configuration tracing, adaptive subscription for YANG notifications, UDP-based transport for configured descriptions, YANG groupings for UDP clients and servers, subscriptions for distributed notifications, YANG notification transport capabilities, extensible YANG model for YANG Push notifications, YANG Push operational data observability enhancements, and an implementation of HTTPs notive draft with Kafka integration and related performance analysis. Decisions were made on several drafts, and action items were assigned for further development and review.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Netconf Over Quick:</strong> Discussions focused on stream usage, authentication, and security considerations. The importance of utilizing the mailing list for design discussions was emphasized.</li>
<li><strong>Yang Groupings for Quick Clients and Servers:</strong> The group discussed and adopted the draft, addressing transport parameters like version, initial RTT, congestion control algorithm, max idle timeout, initial max streams, and keep-alive interval.</li>
<li><strong>List Pagination:</strong> The working group discussed comments from the last call and agreed to move forward with the revised draft.</li>
<li><strong>Augmented By Addition to the Yang Library:</strong> The scope of augmented by was discussed, focusing on direct augmentations.</li>
<li><strong>External Transaction ID for Configuration Tracing:</strong> Minor changes were made, and the draft was deemed ready for last call.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Subscription for Yang Notifications:</strong>  Minor updates based on reviews were discussed, including augmentation of the modification capabilities module and refining use cases, with request for last call.</li>
<li><strong>UDP-based transport for configured descriptions:</strong> The group discussed the removal of private encoding options, DTLS encryption requirements, and adherence to NMDA architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Yang groupings for UDP clients and servers:</strong> The group discussed whether a server should support multiple local ports on a single IP address and voted to maintain the current model with a single port per IP address.</li>
<li><strong>Subscription to distributed notifications:</strong> Review comments were addressed, and the draft was deemed ready for IESG review.</li>
<li><strong>Yang notification transport capabilities:</strong> TLS version support was discussed, and minor adjustments were made based on implementation feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible Yang model for Yang Push Notifications:</strong> Global enabling of the envelope and the addition of the observation timestamp extension were discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Yang Push operational data observability enhancements:</strong> The group discussed simplifying Yang Push and potentially replacing XPaths with a more JSON-friendly YPath.</li>
<li><strong>HTTPs Notive Draft Implementation:</strong> Student researchers presented their implementation, and integration with Kafka.  The group was asked for review.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Netconf over Quick:</strong> Polish the draft based on feedback. Continue discussions on the mailing list. (Action: David Dai)</li>
<li><strong>Yang Groupings for Quick Clients and Servers:</strong> Adopted by the working group. Version should potentially be a leaf-list to allow for supporting multiple versions of Quick (Action: Per Anderson).</li>
<li><strong>List Pagination:</strong> Proceed with revised ID, remove delete operation in restconf draft (Action: Mahash Talili)</li>
<li><strong>Augmented By Addition to the Yang Library:</strong> Follow the format of the deviation in the module states for augmented by (Action: Author)</li>
<li><strong>External Transaction ID for Configuration Tracing:</strong> Ready for working group last call. Update security considerations using RFC 8407 bis. (Action: Jean)</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Subscription for Yang Notifications:</strong> Move to working group last call. (Action: Kent Watson)</li>
<li><strong>UDP-based transport for configured descriptions:</strong> A volunteer will be located for Shepard (Action: Kent Watson)</li>
<li><strong>Yang groupings for UDP clients and servers:</strong> Maintain the current model; the current version is ready to be progressed. A shepherd is needed (Action: Kent Watson)</li>
<li><strong>Subscription to distributed notifications:</strong> Ready for IESG review; find a shepherd. (Action: Kent Watson)</li>
<li><strong>Yang notification transport capabilities:</strong> Update the draft to reflect that TLS 1.2 is not obsolete. (Action: Benoit)</li>
<li><strong>Extensible Yang model for Yang Push Notifications:</strong> Seek feedback on the updated text and implementation. (Action: Alex)</li>
<li><strong>Yang Push operational data observability enhancements:</strong> Plan bi-monthly meetings with co-authors to resolve key points and issues, then request a virtual interim. (Action: Rob Wilson)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to incorporate feedback from the session into revised drafts.</li>
<li>Chairs to initiate working group last calls on drafts ready for progression.</li>
<li>Working group members to review and provide feedback on drafts via the mailing list.</li>
<li>Authors to engage in implementation and interoperability testing.</li>
<li>Shepherds to be assigned to drafts progressing to the IESG.</li>
<li>Plan virtual interim to discuss Yang Push (Action: Rob Wilson, Kent Watson)</li>
