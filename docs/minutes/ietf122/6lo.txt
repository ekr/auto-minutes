# 6lo

## Summary

This meeting covered the status of several 6Lo working group documents, including updates on prefix registration, Path-aware Semantic Addressing (PASA), Generic Address Assignment Option (GAO), SCHC compression, and IPv6 over Optical Wireless Communication (OWC). Several documents are nearing completion and potential submission to the IESG.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RFC 965 Errata:** A potential flag overlap issue was identified between RFC 965 and RFC 8928. An errata report from Adnan is expected.
*   **IPv6 ND Prefix Registration:** This document has passed working group last call and the shepherd write-up is complete.  It's ready for IESG submission, pending AD Eric Vyncke's availability.
*   **PASA and GAO:** The PASA document has been updated to align with the GAO draft and address review comments. The GAO draft has been simplified and clarified. It normatively references PASA.  Both documents should be submitted to the IESG together and will wait in the working group queue until both are ready.
*   **SCHC Compression over 15.4:** The draft has been updated to align with the latest SCHC architecture draft.  The terminology has been updated, and a SCHC stratum header format has been added. Further work includes elaborating on the transition protocol stack, completing frame format examples, and assessing route-over modes.
*   **IPv6 over OWC:**  The draft has been updated based on feedback from IEEE 802.15 members, previous IETF meeting discussions, and IANA comments. These updates address terminology, single-hop/multi-hop interoperability, SCHC compression, and topology.
*   **Normative vs. Informative References:** Guidance was given on correctly classifying document references.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **ACTION:** Adnan to submit an errata report for RFC 965 regarding potential flag overlap with RFC 8928.
*   **DECISION:** The IPV6 ND Prefix Registration document is ready for submission to the IESG.
*   **DECISION:** The PASA and GAO documents will be submitted to the IESG together, and will remain in the working group queue until both are ready.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to continue refining and aligning the SCHC compression draft with the evolving SCHC architecture document.
*   Authors to further develop the IPv6 over OWC draft based on contributor input.
*   Authors to prepare PASA and GAO documents for submission to the IESG.
