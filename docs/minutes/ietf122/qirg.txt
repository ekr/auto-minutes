## Summary

The Quantum Internet Research Group (QIRG) meeting at IETF 122 in Bangkok featured presentations on quantum networking topics. Discussions spanned from near-term applications of quantum networks without quantum memories, to longer-term architectural considerations for a quantum internet. A key theme was the development of a taxonomy and common vocabulary to bridge the gap between physics and network engineering perspectives. The group also considered the need for, and potential structure of, future meetings.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Quantum Multi-Computers:** Rodney discussed recent research on connecting smaller quantum computers to build larger systems, highlighting the roadmap for the evolution of large-scale quantum computers and the necessity of multi-computer interconnects.  Challenges include clock synchronization and network topology.
*   **Quantum Networking in Thailand:** Pruitt, Sucin, and Bumphioreh presented updates on quantum technology development in Thailand, including the government's roadmap for quantum internet and the progress in quantum communication research, quantum key distribution (QKD) testbeds, and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) migration.
*   **Modeling Quantum Repeater Chains:** Oscar presented a model for nodes in quantum repeater chains, focusing on the nature of interfaces and node functionality. The aim is to create a terminology for classifying equipment for design, planning, and configuration.  Feedback on the model's usefulness and placement within the QIRG was solicited.
*   **Quantum Advantage without Quantum Memories:** Wojtek discussed potential quantum network advantages without relying on quantum memories.  He proposed a focus on security, position verification, unforgeable tokens, and task coordination. The goal is to identify valuable applications in the near-term that can leverage existing or near-term technologies.
*   **Multi-Stratum Architecture:** Diego provided an update on the multi-stratum architecture proposal for a quantum internet.  Key elements include network virtualization, decoupling quantum forwarding from service management, and integrating physical and emulated environments. The importance of service units and the challenge of coordinating physical, quantum, and service layers were highlighted.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Oscar:** Will engage with Wyrtek and Rodney to refine the quantum repeater chain model based on feedback. Oscar to work on better defining the purpose of his document with input from the mailing list.
*   **Woitek:** Will add the living document on the list to promote more interaction and improve his use cases and areas he sees advantages on.
*   **Diego:** Will enhance the discussion on virtualization in his draft. He will also analyze detail the service unit concept and start playing with this as service provider is building the network.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for all presentations.
*   Further develop the quantum repeater chain model based on community feedback.
*   Explore the possibility of a QIRG meeting in Madrid in July.
