## Summary

The ivy working group meeting at IETF-122 covered updates on several drafts: base model, network inventory topology, network inventory location, network inventory software, entitlements, and passive inventory. Discussions focused on clarifying terminology, modeling approaches, and addressing open issues for each draft. The group also discussed future augmentations and collaboration with other working groups.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Base Model:** Clarification of terminology, scope, and updates to the model for ports, transceivers, and breakouts. Discussion around slot vs. sub-slot and guidelines for future augmentations. The parent-child relationship was well-received.
*   **Network Inventory Topology:** Focus on augmenting the base inventory for bi-directional navigation between network elements and topology nodes. Discussion about mapping links to physical infrastructure and association with physical interface names.
*   **Entitlements:** Discussion centered on capabilities and entitlements as a means to describe the features and permissions of network elements. Modeling considerations around levels in the hierarchy and integration with device models.
*   **Passive Inventory:** Covered various network scenarios, from optical access to microwave transport. Focus on defining passive components, cables, and their relationship to topology. The working group discussed whether to model passive devices as network elements.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Base Model:** Resolve priority one issues, clean up the model and produce a draft. Explore Mahesh's and others' suggestion on examples for augmentations.
*   **Network Inventory Topology:** Remove cable name definitions and leave to passive inventory to define. Send out issues about which is the best way to define the association of interface to the mailing list for discussion.
*   **Entitlements:** Prepare examples and detailed models showing use case. Explore the read/write attributes of models. Bring pain points and solutions about ONF.
*   **Passive Inventory:** Produce a zero-one revision update to address discussed issues, request for working group adoption.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address open issues and incorporate feedback from the mailing list and the meeting.
*   Design team to produce updated drafts for working group last call consideration.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list to resolve open issues and refine modeling approaches.
