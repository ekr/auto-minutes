## Summary
This IETF 122 WiSH working group session focused on the status of the WHEP specification nearing publication and a discussion on incorporating server-initiated offers into the WHEP draft. A consensus call on whether to include server-initiated offers as part of the main WHEP draft or as an extension is ongoing.  The group also touched upon the discoverability of WHEP URLs and the viability of the working group.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **WHEP Publication:**  WHEP is approved and waiting for publication, expected imminently.
*   **Server-Initiated Offers (WHEP):**
    *   Ongoing consensus call on whether to include server-initiated offers as part of the WHEP draft or as an extension.
    *   Current consensus (7 votes) favors including it in the main WHEP draft vs. an extension (2 votes), with one vote against both options.  The call ends next week.
    *   Concerns raised about the complexity of handling both client-initiated and server-initiated offers, specifically Julius's concerns about the open PR.
    *   Sergio expressed that he will step out as editor of the RFC if the decision is to include server-initiated offers as it greatly increases the required effort.
*   **WHEP URL Discoverability:** Discussed issue of discovering WHEP URLs. Previous discussion with HTTP folks didn't yield clear direction. Suggestion of new URI scheme raised but deemed potentially problematic.
*   **Working Group Viability:** Discussed the importance of making progress to maintain the working group's viability. Active work on server-initiated offers is seen as critical.
*   **Meeting Schedule:** The low attendance raised concern about the current scheduling. The group may consider moving to a more remote format to accommodate more participants.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Wait for the conclusion of the consensus call on server-initiated offers next week.
*   **Action Item:** If consensus lands on including server-initiated offers in the main WHEP draft, raise the question on the mailing list about the readiness of the current PR for merging.
*   **Action Item:** If the existing PR is not deemed ready, solicit contributions from those who voted in favor to create a usable PR. Lorenzo volunteered to help.
*   **Action Item:** Determine Sergio's official role (author vs. contributor) after the consensus call and depending on his desired involvement.
*   **Action Item:** Peng will volunteer to working on server-initiated offers, also offline discussion with some experts also have interest.

## Next Steps

*   Await the results of the consensus call and proceed based on the outcome.
*   Solicit contributions for a new or revised PR regarding server-initiated offers if needed.
*   Address any outstanding comments on the existing PR.
