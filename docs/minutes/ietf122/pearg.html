## Summary

The pearg session at IRTF 122 included a presentation by Kitaro Hashimoto on authentication in MLS and its variants, followed by discussions on the presentation and future research directions for the group. An update on the active draft regarding safe measurement guidelines was also provided.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Authentication in MLS:** Kitaro Hashimoto presented a lightweight authentication method for MLS based on one-time tokens and MAC tags to mitigate denial-of-service attacks and provide anonymity. Discussion points included:
    *   The definition of anonymity in the proposed schemes.
    *   The &quot;unforgeability limitations&quot; of the token scheme, including a potential race condition for message replay attacks.
    *   Tradeoffs between efficiency and security of different authentication methods (signatures vs. one-time tokens).
*   **Safe Measurement Guidelines Draft:** Gersh gave an update on the draft, highlighting improvements based on previous feedback related to negative language and scope clarification. A last call for review and feedback was requested.
*   **Future Research Directions:** A discussion was initiated to gather feedback on future research priorities for the group. Potential topics included:
    *   Privacy implications of shifts in internet governance.
    *   Privacy-preserving techniques relying on multi-party computation.
    *   Censorship-related work and its relationship to privacy.
    *   Privacy reviews of IETF standards and potential organizational structures (e.g., a privacy directorate) to facilitate this.
    *   Retrospective analysis of privacy requirements sections in RFCs.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Review of Safe Measurement Guidelines Draft:** Chairs will send a note to the mailing list to encourage review of the latest version of the safe measurement guidelines draft, focusing on whether it addresses previous concerns.
*   **Future Research Directions Discussion:** Continue the discussion on future research priorities on the mailing list.
*   **Off-line Discussion:** Discuss the fuzzy tag topic offline with Kitaro Hashimoto.

## Next Steps

*   Mailing list discussion on safe measurement guidelines draft and potential future research topics.
*   Chairs to consider interim meetings on focused topics, potentially involving longer meetings with open agenda items.
