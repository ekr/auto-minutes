# DTN Working Group - IETF 122

## Summary

The DTN working group meeting at IETF 122 covered a range of topics, including Co-op over BP, reference scenarios, custody transfer, interplanetary DNS, network management architecture, and quality of service extensions. Discussions focused on technical details, adoption readiness, and future directions for DTN protocols. Several presentations were given, followed by questions and comments from attendees.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Co-op over BP:** Presented updates to the draft, focusing on message aggregation and a new section on proxying. Discussed the interplay between OSCore and BPSEC.  The question of adoption was raised to consider which group takes on ownership.
*   **DTN Reference Scenarios:** Presented reference scenarios for art observation, lunar communication, and Mars communication.  Discussed data formats for the scenarios and plans for publication as a CCSDS yellow book.
*   **BP Version 7 Custody Transfer and Compressed Status Reporting:** Presented updates on custody transfer, bundle sequencing, and compressed bundle reporting. Addressed the need for efficient reporting and opportunistic custody.  The identifier approach was questioned against the source EID and timestamp.
*   **Interplanetary DNS:** Introduced a draft for a coherent model for naming in interplanetary networks.  Discussed discrete DNS networks per world, top-level domains, and the IPN DNS resource record type. Concerns were raised regarding the viability of this approach relative to distributing the root zone.
*   **Network Management Architecture:**  Covered updates to drafts on the AMM, ARI, Yang syntax, and AMP.  Addressed namespace breakdown, organization registrations, and circular normative dependencies.
*   **Bundle Transfer Protocol Unidirectional (BTPU):** Discussed this new direction, presenting use-cases for several types of convergence layer protocols

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Co-op over BP:** Chairs to help liaise with CORE working group chairs and AD regarding potential adoption.
*   **Interplanetary DNS:** Discussion to continue on the mailing list to address technical questions.
*   **BP Version 7 Custody Transfer and Compressed Status Reporting:** Felix to post a link to the work publicly available for those who want to review it.
*   **Bundle Protocol Quality of Service Extensions:** Rick to create GitHub repository for an internet-draft specific to the flow marking functionality.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on the mailing list for open issues and feedback on presented drafts.
*   Await publication of the DTN reference scenarios as a CCSDS yellow book.
*   Further develop and refine existing working group drafts based on feedback received.
*   Prepare for future meetings and discussions in Madrid.
