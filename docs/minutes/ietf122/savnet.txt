## Summary

The savnet meeting covered a variety of topics related to source address validation (SAV) and spoofing prevention, focusing on both intra-domain and inter-domain architectures and solutions. Presentations included updates on deployment status, solution proposals, gap analysis, and YANG data models for SAV management. A key area of discussion was the optimal deployment location for SAV rules within networks, balancing feasibility, effectiveness, and complexity.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Source Address Validation Deployment Status:** A presentation provided insights into the current state of SAV deployment across the internet, highlighting variations in adoption rates across different networks and regions. Measurement methodologies and their validation were discussed.
*   **Intra-Domain SAV Architectures and Solutions:** Discussions centered on where SAV rules should be deployed within an autonomous system (AS), specifically the trade-offs between edge deployments (customer-facing and host-facing routers) and internal router deployments. Challenges related to traffic engineering, policy routing and asymmetric routing within the intradomain were discussed.
*   **Inter-Domain SAV Architectures and Solutions:** Several presentations proposed solutions for inter-domain SAV, including mechanisms for exchanging information about source prefixes and validating traffic at AS borders. Discussions focused on leveraging existing infrastructure and protocols, such as BGP and RPKI.
*   **Gap Analysis and Requirements:** The existing gap analysis document was updated with modifications based on working group feedback and discussion in the meeting.
*   **BMSPF (Bidirectional Metric-Based Shortest Path First):** A presentation on a new intra-domain SAV solution based on BMSPF sparked debate about the practicality of enforcing symmetric routing metrics in real-world networks.
*   **Barsab Updates:** The BarSAB presentation outlined updates to the draft including the detailed algorithm for provider interfaces and the treatment of zero AS numbers in the calculations.
*   **BGP Link-State Advertising:** The possibility of using BGP link-state to advertise intra-domain survey rules generated feedback about whether protocol extensions are in scope for the group and whether the correct protocol was being proposed.
*   **YANG Data Model:** A presentation on a YANG data model for SAV management provided a framework for configuring and managing SAV systems, including tables, rules, and events.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   The working group continues to recommend SAW on the edge and will add descriptions of incremental benefits of this deployment to the draft.
*   The group acknowledged that solution must consider addressing challenges to ensure the goals of SAV can be fulfilled.
*   The group continues discussion of deployment of the survey within the insular domain on the mailing list.
*   The document "Gap Analysis problem statement and the requirements for social address validation in the interdomain networks" should proceed for Working Group Last Call.
*   Authors of inter-domain SAV schemes (such as the scheme based on RFC 5210 and BarSAB) should compare the solutions to remove some challenges in the each other's proposals.
*   The authors will revise the drafts to address comments received during the meeting.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the savnet mailing list regarding specific solutions, deployment strategies, and open issues.
*   Incorporate feedback from the meeting into updated versions of the relevant Internet Drafts.
*   Progress drafts towards Working Group Last Call as appropriate.
