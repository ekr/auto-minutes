## Summary

This PanRG meeting at IETF 122 in Bangkok covered updates on the SCION deployment and draft status, a presentation on quick network awareness technology, and a presentation on a deadline-aware multipath transport protocol (DMTP). The meeting also included a brief discussion about a potential collaboration with the Quantum Internet Research Group (QIRG).

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SCION Deployment and Draft Updates (Niccolo):**
    *   SCION is seeing success in finance and critical infrastructure ecosystems.
    *   The core SCION drafts are under ISE review, and feedback has been received, particularly on the control plane.
    *   Researchers are exploring deploying SCION closer to applications and investigating post-quantum cryptography for SCION.
*   **Quick Network Awareness Technology (Gauching):**
    *   Presented a draft introducing path awareness into the transport or application layer via the quick egg mechanism.
    *   The draft proposes a new quick frame format to carry network status information, such as available bandwidth and path delay.
    *   Discussion highlighted the similarities and differences with the Scone Working Group's work and the importance of defining specific use cases and semantics for the feedback.
*   **Deadline-Aware Multipath Transport Protocol (DMTP) (Tony John):**
    *   Presented DMTP, a protocol designed to meet strict latency requirements for real-time applications using SCION's path awareness.
    *   DMTP uses optimal path selection, smart retransmission, and adaptive forward error correction.
    *   Experiments showed DMTP maintaining consistent performance even at high loss rates compared to MPTCP and multipath quick.
    *   Ongoing work includes standardization through a draft for quick multipath DMTP.
    *   MP Quick group providing feedback to ensure collaboration on multipath solutions

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **SCION Draft Reviews:** Interested individuals with long flights are encouraged to review the SCION drafts and provide feedback, potentially by pinging the ISE beforehand.
*   **DMTP POC Release:** The DMTP developers are encouraged to share their proof-of-concept code with the PANRG mailing list for experimentation and interoperability testing.
*   **QIRG Collaboration:** Chairs to coordinate discussions between PanRG, Datnet, and QIRG regarding potential areas of collaboration and knowledge sharing.
*   **DMTP & MP Quick Interaction**: Encourage DMTP team to continue collaboration with MP Quick to integrate solutions. Also encourage DMTP Team to bring fairness considerations to the CCRG.

## Next Steps

*   Niccolo to provide the ISE with updates on any incoming reviews of the SCION drafts.
*   Gauching to focus on defining specific use cases and semantics for the quick network awareness technology based on community feedback.
*   Tony John to continue revising the DMTP draft, incorporating feedback from the quick working group and progressing towards a prototype implementation.
*   Chairs to facilitate discussions on DMTP's fairness considerations within the CCRG.
*   Chairs to entangle the mailing lists of PANRG, Datnet, and QIRG to start the collaboration discussion.
