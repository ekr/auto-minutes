## Summary

The MOPS (Media Operations) IETF 122 meeting covered several topics related to media streaming and network operations. Key discussion points included a presentation on the impact of network overlays on streaming video, an introduction to the new TIPTOB working group focused on interplanetary IP networking, an update on the Scone working group's progress on standardized network elements for enhanced media delivery, and an update from the Streaming Video Technology Alliance (SVTA) on their activities. The meeting emphasized the importance of collaboration between network operators, application developers, and content providers to improve user experience and address emerging challenges in media delivery.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Network Overlays and Impacts to Streaming:** Discussion centered on how network overlays (routing changes, DNS resolvers, IP address assignment changes) affect streaming video, causing operational issues like inconsistent routing, DNS resolution problems (lack of EDNS0 support), and difficulty in troubleshooting. Specific examples were provided of how these changes impact CDN selection and QoE. Request for concrete operational examples from the community to better document the impact.
*   **TIPTOB (Taking IP To Other Planets):** An introduction to the new working group focusing on adapting IP networking for interplanetary communication. Challenges include long delays, disruptions, low bandwidth, asymmetric links, and limited computing power/energy resources on satellites.
*   **Scone (Standard Company of Network Elements):** An update on the progress of the Scone working group in developing standardized network elements for enhanced media delivery. Focus is on enabling network elements to expose throughput advice to client endpoints to improve ABR decisions. The group is converging on a merged protocol proposal called "Trump". Discussion about how Scone will work where a mobile device may switch networks.
*   **SVTA (Streaming Video Technology Alliance) Update:** Glenn Dean provided an update on SVTA activities, including the merger with DASH-IF, upcoming segments conferences, and the work of the Networking and Transport Group. Of note, is the creation of the new EDGE working group focusing on hosting environments for specialized caches designed to deal with live streaming.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Sanjay and Glenn to incorporate community feedback into the Network Overlays draft, especially concrete operational examples.
*   **Action Item:** Sanjay and Glenn to send the Network Overlays draft to CONE, MASK, and other relevant groups for early review.
*   **Action Item:** MOPS participants to review the Network Overlays draft and provide feedback on use cases, missing issues, and overall direction.
*   **Action Item:** Encourage participation from network operators and application/content provider community in the Scone working group.

## Next Steps

*   Network Overlays draft to be updated based on community feedback and presented at IETF 123. Aim for working group last call at IETF 124.
*   TIPTOB working group to hold its first meeting and gather input on use cases and requirements.
*   Scone working group to continue work on the merged "Trump" protocol.
*   SVTA to continue its work on open caching, networking/transport analysis, and the new EDGE working group.
