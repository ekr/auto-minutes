## Summary

This was the inaugural session of the Restful Provisioning Protocol (RPP) working group. The meeting covered administrative matters, introductions, a discussion of tools and working group processes, updates from the hackathon and tiger team, and preliminary discussions around requirements and architecture. Deliverables and milestones were also introduced for consideration by the working group.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Tools and Working Group Process:** The co-chairs proposed using a GitHub organization for improved traceability and transparency. Use of mailing lists for discussions was favoured over GitHub discussions.
*   **Hackathon Feedback:** The hackathon focused on API development, deployment scenarios, and potential use cases for RPP, resulting in working code for a RPP-to-EPP proxy.
*   **Center Survey:** A survey of registries highlighted commonly used EPP extensions and missing functionality, suggesting potential areas for RPP to address.
*   **Tiger Team Report:** The Tiger team analyzed EPP extensibility, identifying various forms of extensions and providing recommendations for RPP design.
*   **Requirements Exploration:** A preliminary set of requirements were presented, covering API design, data model, data representation, discoverability, EPP compatibility, security, extensibility, and scalability. The working group debated the process for defining and managing requirements (formal document vs. agile approach).
*   **Architecture Discussion:** Resource-oriented architecture, stateless design, and leveraging HTTP capabilities were discussed as key architectural principles for RPP. A layered architecture was proposed to separate transport, data presentation, and resource definition.
*   **Deliverables and Milestones:** A draft timeline was discussed for reaching agreement on key milestones including requirements, architecture and specifications for domain name provisioning.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Martin to document lessons learned from the hackathon.
*   **Action Item:** Co-chairs to review RFC 8874 regarding the use of GitHub.
*   **Action Item:** Co-chairs to consider interim meetings.
*   **Decision:** Requirements to be the initial focus.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list regarding tools, requirements, and architecture.
*   Tiger team to complete its analysis of EPP extensions and report back to the working group at future IETF meetings.
*   Working group to define a clear process for developing and managing requirements.
*   Consider Martin's core RPP draft at a future meeting for adoption.
