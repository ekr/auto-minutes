## Summary
This meeting covered several topics, including the status of existing drafts, option concatenation, a method for generating semantically opaque IPv6 interface identifiers, and results of recent DHCPv6 virtual plugfests. Key discussions revolved around the DHCP Relay Agent draft moving to working group last call, addressing comments on the 8415bis draft, the need to update RFC 3396 regarding option concatenation, the applicability of the IPv6 interface identifier generation method, and the interop testing results.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **DHCP Relay Agent Draft:** Moving to working group last call the week after the IETF meeting.
*   **8415bis Draft:**  Addressed comments from the DNA Directorate and updated several sections. A minor typo was discovered and needs to be fixed. A resubmission as version -11 is required to fix the typo
*   **Option Concatenation (RFC 3396 Update):** The existing RFC 3396 causes problems by recommending concatenation for all option types which results in unexpected behaviors for non-concatenating options. A new draft was presented to address this, aiming to clarify and update the recommendations.
*   **IPv6 Interface Identifier Generation:**  A presentation on a method for generating semantically opaque IPv6 interface identifiers using DHCPv6, based on an individual submission (RFC 7943). Concerns were raised about scalability with small address pools, handling decline and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) scenarios, and the stateful nature of DHCPv6.
*   **Virtual Plugfest Results:** The University of New Hampshire Interoperability Lab presented results from virtual plugfests. Issues were found with client and server implementations regarding PD support, reconfigure exchange, rapid commit, release exchanges, decline messages, T1/T2 timer handling, and no address available status codes.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **8415bis:** Tomiukovsky to resubmit version -11 of the draft to fix the typo.
*   **Option Concatenation Draft:** An adoption call will be initiated on the mailing list. Eric and Bing Chang volunteered to review the document.
*   **IPv6 Interface Identifier Generation Draft:** No decision was made to adopt the document. The discussion should continue on the mailing list, focusing on addressing the raised concerns.

## Next Steps

*   Bernie will send an email to start the working group last call for the DHCP Relay Agent draft the week after the IETF meeting.
*   The discussion about the IPv6 interface identifier generation draft will continue on the mailing list.
*   UNHIOL will post updated interop specs to the Ready Logos website
