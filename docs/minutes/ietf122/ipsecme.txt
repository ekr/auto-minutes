# ipsecme

## Summary

The ipsecme working group meeting covered several topics, including the charter status, adoption calls, and presentations on various drafts. Discussions included a new ESP proposal (EESP), IKEv2 negotiation for EESP, optimized rekeying in IKEv2, post-quantum cryptography in IKEv2, and a security approach for multi-segment SD-WAN.  Several drafts are being considered for working group adoption.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Charter Status:** The working group has been re-chartered since February.
*   **EESP (Enhanced ESP):**
    *   Discussed the need for a new ESP due to limitations in the original protocol.
    *   Highlighted requirements such as performance in hardware and software, parallel processing, and co-existence with ESP.
    *   Hardware implementers provided feedback on TLV structures and the need for a common base protocol.
    *   Debate on whether EESP duplicated functionality already existing in ESP.
*   **IKEv2 Negotiation for EESP:**
    *   Framework for negotiating EESP features (versioning, sub-SAs, sequence numbers) in IKEv2.
    *   Defined a new security protocol in IKEv2 for each version of EESP.
    *   Discussion around KDFs used for sub-SA key derivation.
*   **PECC (Post-quantum Elliptic Curve Cryptography) Updates:**
    *   Proposed a method for using variable-length output PRFs (like KMAC) in IKEv2.
    *   Suggestion to rename the "PRF" registry to "KDF" to better reflect usage.
*   **Optimized Rekeying in IKEv2:**
    *   Discussion on handling PFS and key methods for the initial child SA.
    *   Several options were presented, including regular rekeying, guessing based on configuration, and partial configuration detection.
    *   Concerns raised about incompatibility with multiple key exchanges.
*   **Child PFS Info:**
    *   Discussed a draft adding the KE payload in a notify message to convey initial child information
    *   Presented a structure to define KE type, KE algorithm, and whether it is required for the child
*   **Delete Info:**
    *   A delete info notify message is sent to indicate why an SA is being deleted.
    *   Controversy around including the text field and downtime timer.
*   **Post-Quantum KEM for IKEv2:**
    *   Presented results of experiments using FrodoKEM.
    *   Concerns were raised about the large number of code points requested and whether all variants were necessary.
*   **KEM-Based Authentication for IKEv2:**
    *   Proposed a new authentication method using KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanism) for IKEv2.
    *   Discussion on potential security considerations and complexity compared to signature-based authentication.
*   **ML-KEM (Module Lattice-based KEM) for IKEv2:**
    *   Draft proposing ML-KEM as a key exchange mechanism in IKEv2.
    *   Addresses the final step of post-quantum key exchange
    *   It was noted that IANA code points have been assigned and ready for adoption
*   **Likely Egress Selection Method for Encapsulated Network Segments:**
    *   Proposed the likely egress selection method for encapsulated network segments
    *   Key management for the mechanism was discussed including h-mac and key establishment.
    *   Considered the use of shorter Edge MAC values

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **EESP:** Working group adoption call will be scheduled after further review. Discussions on specific features and potential simplifications will continue on the mailing list.
*   **IKEv2 Negotiation for EESP:**  Working group adoption call will be scheduled.
*   **PECC (Post-quantum Elliptic Curve Cryptography) Updates:** Working group adoption call will be scheduled.
*   **Optimized Rekeying in IKEv2:** The authors will revisit the draft and consider simplifying it, recommending fallback to regular rekeying if optimized rekeying fails.
*   **Delete Info:** The author will take the discussion to the mailing list for further feedback, particularly regarding the text field and downtime timer.
*   **Post-Quantum KEM for IKEv2:** The authors will consider reducing the number of code points requested. Working group adoption call will be scheduled.
*   **ML-KEM for IKEv2:** Working group adoption call will be scheduled.
*   **Likely Egress Selection Method for Encapsulated Network Segments:** Author will explore key generation based on IPSEC keys

## Next Steps

*   Schedule adoption calls for EESP, IKEv2 Negotiation for EESP, PECC, ML-KEM based on the completion of other outstanding adoption calls.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for all presented drafts, focusing on open issues and potential simplifications.
*   Authors to update drafts based on meeting feedback and prepare them for working group adoption.
