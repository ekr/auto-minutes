## Summary
The Secure Shell Maintenance Working Group session at IETF 122 covered several important topics, including the resolution of the NTRU Prime issue, the Terrapin attack and its mitigation using the Strict Kex extension, and a discussion on the proposed SSH certificate format. The chairs emphasized the importance of respectful communication within the group.

## Key Discussion Points

ML-KEM was identified as a potential high-priority candidate. The relationship between the ChaCha20-Poly1305 draft and a draft on strict cipher exchange and key establishment (strict Kex) was also discussed.
