## Summary
The NETMOD working group meeting covered several important topics, including document status updates, discussions on outstanding issues with specific drafts, an update on Yang packages, Yang templates, and a discussion on errata handling for YANG modules.  A presentation was also made about the Delay Tolerant Network Management Architecture (DTNMA) and its potential use of YANG.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Document Status:**  Review of current status of working group documents.  CISLog is in the RFC Editor queue. Several documents are submitted for publication. Concerns raised about warnings/errors from IETF validation tools.
*   **6991 BIS Post Last Call Discussion:**
    *   MAC address regex: Resolved to keep the existing regex and update the description to clarify it's not a general MAC address definition, but specific to the historical context.
    *   URI type-def:  Consensus to remove the sentence "all unnecessary percent encoding is removed" pending further review of normalization considerations.
    *   Date and time compatibility:  Consensus to break backward compatibility and replace "-00:00" with "Z" in the canonical format.
*   **Yang Packages Draft Update:**  Updates on the Yang Packages Draft. Discussed mounted schema and conflict resolution. The next step is to write a simple package compiler to validate the proposed mechanisms.
*   **Yang Templates Update:** Presentation on Yang Templates and a short history of the subject. Requirement gathering is well under way.
*   **BBF and YANG Groupings** Presentation on BBF short term methods and questions whether IETF should get involved with BBF groupings. Working group chair said no and the WG will focus on single standard template solution.
*   **YANG Module Errata:** Discussed potential process for updating YANG modules with errata.  Concerns were raised about who would approve the changes and how the process should be documented.
*   **DTNMA and YANG:**  Presentation on the Delay Tolerant Network Management Architecture and its potential use of YANG. Concern was raised that this would be a fork of the language. The working group chairs will set up future meetings on the list.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **6991 BIS:**
    *   MAC Address: Clarify the description of the MAC address type-def. (Action: Mahesh to update the document)
    *   URI: Remove the sentence about unnecessary percent encoding. (Action: Mahesh to update the document)
    *   Date/Time: Break backward compatibility and use "Z" for UTC. (Action: Mahesh to update the document)
*   **Yang Packages:** Rob to write a simple package compiler to validate the design (Action: Rob)
*   **YANG Module Errata:** Working group is in favor of creating new RFC for the process. (Action: Balaj to write a draft)
*   **DTNMA and YANG:** Discussion will move to the mailing list. It will be helpful to understand what problems are trying to be solved (Action: The DN working group to list the issues)

## Next Steps
*   Authors to update documents based on the decisions made in the meeting.
*   Follow-up discussions on Yang Templates and DTNMA on the mailing list.
*   Next meeting in Madrid.
