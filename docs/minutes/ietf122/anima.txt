## Summary

The anima working group meeting at IETF 122 in Bangkok covered the status of several drafts, including Bruski PRM, Bruski Cloud, and the anima grass distribution draft.  Discussions also included potential adoption of new work items related to registrar/MASA considerations and network controller managed A&I infrastructure. Presentations were given on Constrained Bruski, Constrained Joint Proxy, 8366bis, and Lightweight GRASP. A new draft on mobility management was introduced and discussed.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Bruski PRM:**  Aligned with the latest JWS voucher version and addressed comments from expert reviews.  Now on the telechat for April 17th.
*   **Bruski Cloud:** Waiting for error director go-ahead after addressing questions from dash 13.
*   **anima grass distribution:** Prototype implementation in progress, aiming for proposed standards rather than experimental. Refining use cases.
*   **Bruski Discovery:**  Review requests sent out, aiming for Working Group Last Call by next IETF. Early IANA review requested due to significant registry implications.
*   **Registrar/MASA Considerations & Network Controller Managed A&I Infrastructure:** Discussion on the mailing list is encouraged to determine gating factors before adoption call.
*   **Constrained Bruski:** Editorial updates made, clarifying COSE X5 bag structure and requiring Cibor for telemetry messages.  Proposal to reuse existing COSE method for assigning timestamp.  Dependencies on Constrained Joint Proxy and 8366bis.
*   **Constrained Joint Proxy:** Editorial overhaul and corrections made. Mode selection simplified (stateless/stateful). Focus now only on COAP discovery.  Open issue: registrar selection problem. Potential second Working Group Last Call after addressing registrar selection.
*   **8366bis:**  Extension process discussed, adopting approach from RFC 8530 (MUD). Discussion regarding extension mechanism for Yang modules and voucher modules. A manufacturer simple extension which would allow non-interoperable private extensions was also discussed.
*   **Lightweight GRASP:**  Proposed COAP-based lightweight GRASP in addition to UDP-based.  Discussion on the need for two approaches.
*   **Mobile Management and Capability Negotiation:**  Draft introduced, classifying mobility protocols and proposing negotiation principles.  Exploring relationship to anima.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Bruski Discovery:** Authors to address reviewer comments.
*   **Registrar/MASA Considerations & Network Controller Managed A&I Infrastructure:** Start a discussion on the mailing list.
*   **Constrained Joint Proxy:** Address registrar selection problem.
*   **8366bis:**
    *   Michael to ping Alex Clem for extension model review.
    *   Kent to review the yang extensions.
*   **Lightweight GRASP:** Start a thread on the mailing list to discuss the need for two approaches (UDP vs. COAP) and whether to adopt one.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on the mailing list for potential new work items.
*   Address open issues in current drafts and progress towards Working Group Last Call.
*   Schedule interims or weekly meetings to progress work before the next IETF.
