<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 17 Mar 2025 02:30</p>
<h1>savnet</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The savnet meeting covered a variety of topics related to source address validation (SAV) and spoofing prevention, focusing on both intra-domain and inter-domain architectures and solutions. Presentations included updates on deployment status, solution proposals, gap analysis, and YANG data models for SAV management. A key area of discussion was the optimal deployment location for SAV rules within networks, balancing feasibility, effectiveness, and complexity.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source Address Validation Deployment Status:</strong> A presentation provided insights into the current state of SAV deployment across the internet, highlighting variations in adoption rates across different networks and regions. Measurement methodologies and their validation were discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Intra-Domain SAV Architectures and Solutions:</strong> Discussions centered on where SAV rules should be deployed within an autonomous system (AS), specifically the trade-offs between edge deployments (customer-facing and host-facing routers) and internal router deployments. Challenges related to traffic engineering, policy routing and asymmetric routing within the intradomain were discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Inter-Domain SAV Architectures and Solutions:</strong> Several presentations proposed solutions for inter-domain SAV, including mechanisms for exchanging information about source prefixes and validating traffic at AS borders. Discussions focused on leveraging existing infrastructure and protocols, such as BGP and RPKI.</li>
<li><strong>Gap Analysis and Requirements:</strong> The existing gap analysis document was updated with modifications based on working group feedback and discussion in the meeting.</li>
<li><strong>BMSPF (Bidirectional Metric-Based Shortest Path First):</strong> A presentation on a new intra-domain SAV solution based on BMSPF sparked debate about the practicality of enforcing symmetric routing metrics in real-world networks.</li>
<li><strong>Barsab Updates:</strong> The BarSAB presentation outlined updates to the draft including the detailed algorithm for provider interfaces and the treatment of zero AS numbers in the calculations.</li>
<li><strong>BGP Link-State Advertising:</strong> The possibility of using BGP link-state to advertise intra-domain survey rules generated feedback about whether protocol extensions are in scope for the group and whether the correct protocol was being proposed.</li>
<li><strong>YANG Data Model:</strong> A presentation on a YANG data model for SAV management provided a framework for configuring and managing SAV systems, including tables, rules, and events.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>The working group continues to recommend SAW on the edge and will add descriptions of incremental benefits of this deployment to the draft.</li>
<li>The group acknowledged that solution must consider addressing challenges to ensure the goals of SAV can be fulfilled.</li>
<li>The group continues discussion of deployment of the survey within the insular domain on the mailing list.</li>
<li>The document &quot;Gap Analysis problem statement and the requirements for social address validation in the interdomain networks&quot; should proceed for Working Group Last Call.</li>
<li>Authors of inter-domain SAV schemes (such as the scheme based on RFC 5210 and BarSAB) should compare the solutions to remove some challenges in the each other's proposals.</li>
<li>The authors will revise the drafts to address comments received during the meeting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussions on the savnet mailing list regarding specific solutions, deployment strategies, and open issues.</li>
<li>Incorporate feedback from the meeting into updated versions of the relevant Internet Drafts.</li>
<li>Progress drafts towards Working Group Last Call as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
