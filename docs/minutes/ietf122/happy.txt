## Summary

The inaugural meeting of the "happy" working group focused on Happy Eyeballs Version 3 (HEv3), a proposed update to the connection establishment algorithm. Discussions covered the scope of HEv3, including incorporation of newer technologies like QUIC and SVCB, and strategies for detecting and reporting misconfigured networks. The group also addressed the use of GitHub for document management and proposed workflows. Several open issues were identified, particularly regarding the interaction of SVCB records with ECH and ALPN, and the handling of IPv6-only networks.  Presentations included an overview of the HEv3 draft, a status update on Chromium's HEv3 implementation, and a proposal for reporting network errors.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Happy Eyeballs v3 Scope:** Focused on connection establishment, excluding multi-link scenarios and connection pooling.
*   **GitHub Usage:**  Issue filing and pull requests for document changes, with chairs initially having the authority to merge editorial and design changes.
*   **SVCB Integration:**  Challenges in sorting addresses with SVCB priorities, ALPN considerations, and ECH requirements. How to reconcile server-provided priorities with client preferences for features like ECH and Quick.
*   **Historical Performance Data:** How to incorporate historical performance data for route selection, with considerations for network changes.
*   **IPv6-only Networks:** Special considerations for DNS resolution in IPv6-only networks using NAT64, including whether synthesized addresses should be treated differently.
*   **Optimistic DNS:**  Discussion of whether HEv3 should reference or define optimistic DNS practices.
*   **Error Reporting:** A proposal to enhance network error reporting through browser APIs to improve observability of subtle network issues beyond simple connection failures, leading to discussion of privacy concerns with providing such detailed information. Concerns about potential network topology leakage. How to balance reporting with user privacy.
*   **Limited Scoping:**  Scoping of the effort given differing network stack implementations such as those used by Chromium versus lower level libraries.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Adopt Happy Eyeballs V3 Document:** A poll indicated support for adopting the presented document as a starting point for HEv3. This will be confirmed via email to the working group mailing list.
*   **GitHub Wiki:** A wiki area will be added to the GitHub repository for implementation notes and measurement information.
*   **Implementation Section:**  Tommy (author of the HEv3 draft) will add a minimal implementation section to the draft, pointing to the GitHub wiki.
*   **Measurement Data:** Request for measurement data related to HEv3 from implementers, to be shared via the chairs and included on the Wiki.
*   **GitHub Issue on Limited Scoping:** Lorenzo will create a GitHub issue to discuss the limitations of implementing HEv3 in certain networking stacks.
*   **Consider Interim Meeting:** A virtual interim meeting was considered to discuss specific topics in more detail. A decision will be made based on progress on GitHub issues and editor contributions. David to ensure appropriate participation.

## Next Steps

*   Confirm adoption of the Happy Eyeballs V3 document via email list.
*   Add implementation section to draft pointing to the GitHub wiki.
*   Add wiki for implementation details on GitHub.
*   Continue discussion of open issues on GitHub.
*   Evaluate the need for an interim meeting based on progress on GitHub.
