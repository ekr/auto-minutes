<h1>iabopen</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The IAB Open meeting covered several key topics, including updates on IAB technical programs (E-Impact, EDM), a review of the recent NEMOPS workshop, updates on IAB liaison RFCs, and a report on the IETF's liaison relationship with the W3C. Discussions highlighted the need for better operator engagement, improved tooling for network management, and clearer communication regarding liaison relationships.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>E-Impact Program:</strong> The E-Impact design team has released a zero-zero draft and is seeking feedback, particularly at the Sustainability Proposed Research Group. The group aims to define its end goals.</li>
<li><strong>EDM Program:</strong> The EDM program on evolvability, deployability, and maintainability is planning renewed activity in the coming months. New program leads Jana and Warren were welcomed.</li>
<li><strong>NEMOPS Workshop:</strong> The workshop revisited network management after 22 years, emphasizing the need to engage more with the operator community. Key findings included the continued prevalence of CLI and SNMP, despite advancements in Netconf and YANG; and the importance of ease of use in network management tools. Participants discussed challenges in transitioning to YANG, model divergence, and the need for interoperability testing.</li>
<li><strong>IAB Liaison RFC Updates:</strong> The IAB is updating RFCs 4052 and 4053, which define the liaison process. The updates aim to clarify when to send liaison statements, when to establish formal relationships, and remove outdated information on tooling.</li>
<li><strong>W3C Liaison:</strong> The IETF is trialing a cross-area review team with the W3C to leverage expertise in areas such as internationalization. W3C has provided valuable reviews on IETF last calls.  Clarification is needed on the origin of W3C reviews during IETF last calls.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>E-Impact:</strong> Solicit feedback on the zero-zero draft at the Sustainability Proposed Research Group.</li>
<li><strong>IAB Liaison RFCs:</strong> Community to review and provide feedback on the updated liaison RFC drafts on the architecture discuss list.</li>
<li><strong>W3C Liaison:</strong> The IAB needs to figure out some kind of pre-amble to add to W3C review emails to make things clearer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussions on NEMOPS workshop findings within the NMOPs working group and the Ops area.</li>
<li>Advance the updated IAB Liaison RFCs (4052 and 4053) towards IAB adoption and IETF last call.</li>
<li>Monitor and evaluate the ongoing trial of the cross-area review team with the W3C.</li>
<li>IAB will dive into the WISIS plus 20 process at the next meeting.</li>
</ul>

<h1>iabopen</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This IAB Open session focused on the WISIS+20 process, a UN-sponsored review of the World Summit on the Information Society. The session provided background on WISIS, discussed the role of the IETF, and included a perspective from the Australian government. Key discussion points included the importance of multi-stakeholderism, the need for the technical community to engage with governments, and the IETF's role in providing the building blocks for a well-functioning internet. Several participants raised concerns about diversity within the IETF and the need for self-criticism regarding the shortcomings of the multi-stakeholder model.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>WISIS+20 Review:</strong>  The upcoming WISIS+20 review presents both an opportunity and a risk to the existing multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance. The review could reaffirm or challenge the current system.</li>
<li><strong>IETF's Role:</strong> The IETF plays a critical role in providing the technical building blocks for a secure, trustworthy, and unfragmented internet. The IETF's open and transparent processes are exemplary for multi-stakeholder engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Government Engagement:</strong>  The technical community needs to actively engage with governments to educate them about the internet and advocate for open standards and multi-stakeholder governance.  Governments may not fully understand the technical aspects and benefits of the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity and Inclusion:</strong> The IETF needs to continue to improve diversity and inclusion within its community. Participation in the IETF can be an economic privilege. The IETF has invested in related programs and is seeking to improve.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Stakeholderism Criticism:</strong> The multi-stakeholder model has its failures, and they must be recognised. Increased internet regulation is a symptom of said shortcomings. There are concerns about centralization and the distribution of digital prosperity.</li>
<li><strong>Speaking Government:</strong> The technical community needs to learn how to communicate effectively with government officials and policymakers. The technical community should offer their expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Openness and Accessibility:</strong> The IETF, while open and transparent, could be more proactive in reaching out to policymakers and other stakeholders and should reflect where it can improve.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>The IAB and ISOC will continue to collaborate on refining input into the IGF and WISIS processes.</li>
<li>IETF members are encouraged to engage with their national or regional consultations regarding WISIS.</li>
<li>The IAB will consider the feedback from the session and continue to refine its approach to engaging with the WISIS process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>The IAB and ISOC will continue to develop talking points and strategies for engaging with governments and other stakeholders.</li>
<li>The IAB will continue to monitor the WISIS+20 process and provide updates to the IETF community.</li>
<li>The IAB should consider what steps to take to improve diversity, and the existing process around leadership selection.</li>
