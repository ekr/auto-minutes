## Summary

The CATS working group meeting focused on updates and next steps for the three working group documents: Use Cases and Requirements, Framework, and Metrics. Key discussion points included issues with encryption, synchronization of data, and prioritization of requirements. There were discussions about collaboration with other standards organizations and whether to publish the use cases and requirements as an RFC.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **CATS Framework:** Discussion on handling encrypted service identifiers and how classifiers can function with encrypted traffic. Need to clarify which layer identifiers will be provided at. Concerns raised about manageability and the need for a document shepherd.
*   **CATS Use Cases and Requirements:** Review of updates, including addressing comments and correlating use cases and requirements. Discussion of a new ISAC (Integrated Sensing and Communications) use case and associated requirements. Concerns raised about data synchronization. Prioritization of requirements and whether the use cases and requirements should be published as an RFC.
*   **CATS Metrics:** Review of updates to the metric definition document. Discussions around the classification of metrics in several levels, clarification for vendors, and implementation guidance on using CATS metrics.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **CATS Framework:**
    *   Matt to send an email to the mailing list regarding the encrypted service identifier issue.
    *   Working group to look at the PCE manageability considerations document.
    *   Volunteer needed for document shepherd role.
*   **CATS Use Cases and Requirements:**
    *   Authors to check with use case contributors to ensure no requirements were accidentally deleted.
    *   Further review of requirements 19 and 20 to determine if they are truly CATS requirements.
    *   Authors to revise the wording of requirement 14 for clarity.
    *   Carlos to identify new ISAAC requirements that have not already been captured.
    *   Provide additional information on service segmentation in the document.
*   **CATS Metrics:**
    *   Add options on to implementation guidance in the document.

## Next Steps

*   **CATS Framework:**
    *   Address open issues in GitHub.
    *   Working group Last Call.
*   **CATS Use Cases and Requirements:**
    *   Polish the existing document.
    *   Address comments from Paul and Julian.
    *   Merge other use cases and requirements if ready.
    *   Decide the target last call date.
*   **CATS Metrics:**
    *   Polish and solidify metric representation and encoding.
    *   Authors will set the submission to IESG for Oking Guru.
