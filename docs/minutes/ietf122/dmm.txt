## Summary

The DMM (Distributed Mobility Management) working group meeting covered several key topics, including updates on working group documents, individual draft presentations, and a summary of the 6G summit. Discussions centered on the readiness of documents for last call, architectural considerations for mobile user plane technologies, network slicing for 5G, traffic steering, SRv6 enhancements, and computing-aware traffic filtering. The meeting also addressed the need for more reviews of submitted drafts and the importance of community involvement in 3GPP standards development.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Architecture discussion on SRv6 mobile user plane:**  The presentation covered converting mobile session information into routing information using SRv6 capabilities. Questions were raised about charging and lawful intercept, which will be addressed in a future draft. The document is considered ready for working group last call.
*   **Mobility aware transport network slicing for 5G:**  Discussion focused on the document's status as informational versus standard, particularly due to the inclusion of a YANG model. The mapping between 3GPP slices (SNSAI) and IETF slices was a key area of inquiry. More details on data model and 3GPP specs are needed.
*   **Mobile traffic steering:** The presentation addressed the update to the mobile traffic steering document, where the important interfaces are control and data plan interfaces between UPA and transport network. There were changes in the sections regarding operational aspects with centralized, distributed, and hybrid models. A question was raised regarding the need to clarify the definition of traffic steering within the draft.
*   **SRH reduction for SRv6 MUP:**  The presentation covered a proposed new behavior for NMGTP6E, aiming to make it more hardware-friendly. The working group was asked to conduct an adoption call. Whether it should be a separate document was asked.
*   **Map architecture:** Several updates after the adoption call were described. Concerns raised addressed DM requirements. Discussion about segment types and session transport route was included.
*   **Computing Aware Traffic Filtering Considerations for Map Architecture:** A discussion of a possible enhancement for MAP architecture to support the cast concept. Sticky and stable service mobility case support was reviewed.
*   **6G Summit Summary:** Lionel provided a summary of the 6G summit, highlighting the need for network simplification, the slow adoption of slicing in 5G, and the potential for a new data plane in 6G. 3GPP is expected to approve the first study item in June and architecture discussions in SA2 will then start.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **SRv6 mobile user plane:** Authors to address comments on charging and lawful intercept in a future draft. The document to proceed to working group last call.
*   **Mobility aware transport network slicing for 5G:** John to check with Eric and close it on this, to determine if information track is fine or needs to move to standards track. Authors to revise the draft to clarify the mapping between 3GPP and IETF slices.
*   **Mobile traffic steering:** Authors to clarify the definition of traffic steering within the draft.
*   **SRH reduction for SRv6 MUP:** Issue an adoption call on the mailing list.
*   **Map architecture:** Issue a working group call.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to revise drafts based on feedback received during the meeting.
*   Working group chairs to initiate adoption calls and last calls as appropriate.
*   Encourage more working group members to volunteer for document reviews.
*   Follow up on the status of implementations related to the map architecture draft.
*   Encourage participation in 3GPP standards development to influence the direction of 6G.
