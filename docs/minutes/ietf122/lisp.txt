## Summary

The LISP working group meeting covered several key topics, including updates on existing drafts, experiences with LISP multicast deployments, and the progression of LISP DDTB and NAT traversal documents.  The group also discussed the El CAF document and potential next steps.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **LISP Map Server Reliable Transport:** The presenter needs to review the IANA section and move it forward before IETF 123 in Madrid.
*   **LISP Traffic Engineering (LISP-TE):** Publication has been requested and will undergo AD review.
*   **LISP Meave Model:** Requires a new revision to address minor concerns; then ready for working group last call.
*   **LISP Distinguished Name Encoding:**  Published as RFC after resolving security concerns.
*   **LISP Multicast Deployment Use Cases:** Presented by Prasad, focusing on deployment scenarios and scope. Discussion included:
    *   The draft supports the advancement of 6831 BIS and covers L2/L3 multicast.
    *   Use cases range from temporary events to more established environments.
    *   Migration from one underlay to another is not covered in the document.
    *   Discussion on whether the draft belongs to LISP, PIM, or MBONED working group, with the consensus that it belongs to LISP.
    *   Concerns raised about the terminology used to describe a collection of LISP sites within an administrative domain.
*   **LISP Delegated Database Tree (LISP DDT):** The document is moving from RFC 8111 to a standard track. Discussed the following:
    *   Restructuring of the document for clarity.
    *   Inversion of message format and content description.
    *   Modification of the IID field and database ID.
    *   Proposed removal of unused fields (priority, weight, multicast priority, multicast weight) in the map referral message format.
    *   Discussion about how to handle error cases.
*   **LISP NAT Traversal:** Discussion covered:
    *   The mechanism of NAT discovery and registration.
    *   Security implications and authentication procedures.
    *   Proposed changes to data plane encapsulation for map notify messages.
    *   Concerns about backward compatibility with existing implementations.
*   **EL CAF:**  Discussion of RFC 8060. Next steps involve changing the Experimental type of EL CAF, working group review merged with 9306.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item (Presenter):** Review the IANA section for LISP Map Server Reliable Transport and move it forward before IETF 123 in Madrid.
*   **Action Item (Prasad):** Evaluate the multicast priority/weight fields in the LISP DDT document and provide feedback on their removal.
*   **Action Item (Editors - LISP DDT):**  Add a section detailing how to handle error cases/negative scenarios in the LISP DDT document.
*   **Action Item (Editors - LISP DDT):** Investigate the addition of a section discussing potential backward compatibility issues.
*   **Decision:** The LISP DDT document is ready for working group adoption.
*   **Action Item (Editors - LISP NAT Traversal):**  Work with the original authors on the author list and contributors section.
*   **Action Item (Editors - LISP NAT Traversal):** Incorporate a section summarizing the changes made, specifically switching between 32 and 24 bits for the IID.

## Next Steps

*   Submit the LISP DDT document for working group adoption.
*   Address action items related to the LISP NAT Traversal document.
*   Discuss EL CAF further on the mailing list or at the next IETF meeting.
