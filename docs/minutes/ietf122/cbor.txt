# CBOR Working Group Meeting Minutes

## Summary

The CBOR working group met to discuss three main items: CBOR Packed (Packs) tag consumption concerns, adoption of the DNS CBOR draft, and Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN) string escaping mechanisms. Key discussions centered around conserving precious CBOR tag resources for Packs, evaluating the DNS CBOR draft for working group adoption, and resolving technical details for EDN string handling and Unicode escaping.

## Key Discussion Points

### CBOR Packed (Packs) Tag Consumption
- **Tag Resource Constraints**: Analysis shows only 158 one-plus-one tags remaining free out of 232 total, with 74 already consumed over 11 years (≈7 tags/year)
- **Current Proposal**: Draft requests 40 tags (≈25% of remaining one-plus-one tags), raising sustainability concerns for multi-decade usage
- **Three Approaches Discussed**:
  - **Reduced approach**: Scale down to 24 tags (16 + 8 for straight/inverted references)
  - **Radical reduction**: Use zero additional tags by employing tag 6 with two-element arrays
  - **Status quo**: Proceed with 40 tags as currently specified
- **Trade-offs**: Radical reduction conserves tags but adds ~1 byte overhead per argument reference; reduced approach offers middle ground

### DNS CBOR Draft Adoption
- **Motivation**: Achieve 50% message size reduction in constrained networks using CBOR encoding
- **Recent Updates**: Added resource record set summarization capability and name compression using Packed CBOR
- **Implementation Status**: Draft has been shared with DNS experts and received positive feedback
- **Charter Compatibility**: Action item for chairs to verify alignment with CBOR working group charter

### Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN) String Handling
- **Extension Requirements**: Need third-party extensibility while maintaining isolation, implementation flexibility, and permissionless innovation
- **String Types**: Double-quoted (JSON-compatible), single-quoted (bare), and app strings (prefixed, single-quoted)
- **Unicode Escaping Debate**: 
  - **Consensus items**: Valid JSON should be valid EDN, editor syntax highlighting support needed
  - **Open questions**: Whether to support `\u{...}` format alongside JSON's `\uXXXX`, escaping mechanisms for app strings
- **Key Tension**: Balance between providing universal Unicode escaping vs. leveraging existing format-specific mechanisms

## Decisions and Action Items

- **Chairs**: Verify DNS CBOR draft alignment with working group charter
- **Chairs**: Issue call for objections on adopting DNS CBOR draft
- **Chairs**: Schedule interim meetings (possibly 90 minutes instead of 60 minutes for future sessions)
- **Working Group**: Continue EDN escaping discussion on mailing list due to time constraints
- **CBOR Packed**: No final decision made; feedback indicated preference for radical reduction approach, but benchmarking needed

## Next Steps

- **CBOR Packed**: Develop benchmarks to quantify performance impacts of different tag allocation approaches
- **DNS CBOR**: Await charter review and formal adoption process
- **EDN**: Resume detailed technical discussion on mailing list regarding string escaping mechanisms, Unicode handling, and extension compatibility
- **Interim Meetings**: Check secretariat-provided dates for upcoming interim sessions
