# ntp Session

## Summary

The ntp working group met with a light agenda, primarily focusing on document status updates, administrative items, and planning for future work. The YANG data model has been published, while "Interleave Modes" and "Mode 6 Commands" are in IESG stages. A Working Group Last Call (WGLC) was issued for the "Chronos" document. A key discussion revolved around changing the "Update Registries" document to Standards Track, necessitating a short WGLC. For the "PTP Enterprise Profile", approval from IEEE has been received, and a strategy for handling the "master/slave" terminology (referencing ongoing IEEE 1588 work) was adopted. The working group decided to proceed with Calls for Adoption for both the NTPv5 protocol draft and the NTP over PTP draft. A new discussion point regarding supporting local time in NTPv5 was raised and deferred to the mailing list. The chairs announced plans for monthly virtual interims and a potential hackathon for "Rough Time" at IETF 115.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Administrative**:
    *   Reminder of IETF Notewell and meeting etiquette (masking, mic queue, audio/video off for remote participants not speaking).
    *   Scribe and Jabber scribe were present; note-taking encouraged on the shared notepad.
    *   Agenda was light, with a plan to schedule monthly virtual interim meetings to maintain progress.
*   **Working Group Document Status**:
    *   **NTP Yang Data Model**: Published.
    *   **Interleave Modes** and **Mode 6 Commands**: Currently in IESG stages.
    *   **Chronos**: Working Group Last Call (WGLC) was issued. Working Group members are urged to review and provide comments on the mailing list to demonstrate consensus.
    *   **Update Registries**:
        *   Previously passed WGLC and was ready for IESG.
        *   Following a review, the document's type was questioned (Informational vs. Standards Track).
        *   Given it updates a Standards Track document, it was decided to switch this document to Standards Track.
        *   A very short WGLC will be performed specifically for this change.
    *   **PTP Enterprise Profile**:
        *   Approval from IEEE to share the underlying specification for review has been received.
        *   Addresses terminology issues (e.g., "master clocks" and "slave clocks") from IEEE 1588. The current IETF draft will use 1588 terminology with a note that 1588 is actively working on updating this language. The IETF document is a profile of 1588, so it will follow 1588's language, assuming the IETF draft will be published before the 1588 terminology update is finalized.
*   **Specific Document Discussions**:
    *   **NTPv5 Use Cases and Requirements (`draft-ietf-ntp-ntpv5-use-cases-requirements`)**:
        *   James published -00 with editorial changes.
        *   Working Group review requested.
        *   Question raised by Dieter about considering RFC 7384 (TickTock security requirements) in Section 5. James was not aware of it and will review it.
    *   **Rough Time**:
        *   No updates to the document.
        *   Interest in implementation experiments and a potential hackathon effort for IETF 115.
    *   **NTPv5 Protocol (`draft-mlichvar-ntp-ntpv5`)**:
        *   Discussion on meeting the requirements document.
        *   James indicated five outstanding issues from a previous analysis (ossification, minimizing abuse capability, no notifications, connection reestablishment), but these are not considered insurmountable.
        *   Decision to proceed with a Call for Adoption.
    *   **NTP over PTP (`draft-mlichvar-ntp-ntp-over-ptp`)**:
        *   Miroslav suggested a Call for Adoption.
        *   Noted a potential issue with the `sequence id` field (currently specified as always zero) that might conflict with some drivers. This would need to be addressed.
        *   Decision to proceed with a Call for Adoption.
    *   **NTS for PTP**:
        *   Two proposals exist, with primary advocates intending to merge them into a single approach. This has not yet occurred, and one author is currently busy with graduate studies.
        *   No updates.
*   **Other Business**:
    *   **NTPv5 Local Time Support**: Miroslav proposed supporting local time (instead of UTC) in NTPv5 to simplify client logic for small embedded computers. This could be controversial.
    *   Discussion indicated it's worth exploring use cases and implications. Decision to move the discussion to the mailing list.

## Decisions and Action Items

**Decisions:**

*   The `draft-ietf-ntp-update-registries` document will be changed from Informational to Standards Track. A very short Working Group Last Call (WGLC) will be issued specifically for this change.
*   The working group will proceed with a Call for Adoption for `draft-mlichvar-ntp-ntpv5` (NTPv5 protocol specification).
*   The working group will proceed with a Call for Adoption for `draft-mlichvar-ntp-ntp-over-ptp`.

**Action Items:**

*   **Working Group Members**: Review the `chronos` WGLC and provide comments on the mailing list.
*   **James**: Review RFC 7384 ("Security Requirements for Time Protocols in IETF") and consider its implications for `draft-ietf-ntp-ntpv5-use-cases-requirements`.
*   **Miroslav**: Initiate a discussion on the ntp mailing list regarding supporting "Alternative Time Scale for NTPv5" (e.g., local time).
*   **Chairs**: Schedule monthly virtual interims for the ntp working group.
*   **Chairs/WG**: Explore planning a hackathon effort for "Rough Time" in conjunction with IETF 115.
*   **Chairs**: Monitor progress of drafts and virtual interims to decide on requesting agenda time for IETF 115.

## Next Steps

*   Issue a short WGLC for `draft-ietf-ntp-update-registries` to confirm the change to Standards Track.
*   Issue Calls for Adoption for `draft-mlichvar-ntp-ntpv5` and `draft-mlichvar-ntp-ntp-over-ptp`.
*   Convene monthly virtual interim meetings to progress existing drafts and new work items.
*   Actively engage in the mailing list discussion regarding NTPv5 local time support.
*   Primary authors of NTS for PTP are encouraged to merge their proposals.
