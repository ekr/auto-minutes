<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 24 Jul 2022 16:30</p>
<h1>Tutorial: Newcomers</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This tutorial provided a comprehensive overview for newcomers to IETF 114, covering the organization's structure, meeting week mechanics, cultural aspects, and essential resources. The session emphasized IETF's unique model as a Standards Development Organization (SDO), its consensus-driven process, and practical guidance for effective participation, both in-person and remotely. Key activities and support systems for newcomers at IETF 114 were highlighted.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attendance Tracking</strong>: Attendees were instructed to scan a QR code for attendance, replacing traditional blue sheets. This practice is mandatory for all meetings and ensures proper record-keeping for the standards process.</li>
<li><strong>Queueing Methodology</strong>: For asking questions during sessions, both in-person and remote attendees must use the virtual queue system (via MeetEcho Light for in-person, MeetEcho for remote) to ensure fairness and manage speaker order.</li>
<li><strong>COVID-19 Policy</strong>: Attendees were requested to wear masks in meeting rooms, removing them only when speaking at the microphone.</li>
<li><strong>Tutorial Scope</strong>: The tutorial focused on preparing participants for IETF 114 and an effective introduction to the IETF, rather than its history, how to write a standard, or bringing new work (though pointers were given).</li>
<li><strong>IETF Notewell and BCPs</strong>: Participants were reminded of the importance of reading the IETF Notewell, which outlines general policies and rules, including Best Current Practices (BCPs), anti-harassment, and intellectual property policies. BCPs define either technology best practices or IETF operational guidelines.</li>
<li><strong>Newcomer Activities (IETF 114 Specific)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Newcomers Overview Tutorial (this session)</li>
<li>Quick Connections (today, 4 PM, sign-up encouraged)</li>
<li>Newcomers Dinner (tomorrow evening, sign-up required, email for details)</li>
<li>Remote Newcomers Coffee Break (in Gather, details in emails)</li>
<li>On-site Newcomers Feedback Session (Thursday morning, with food)</li>
<li>Remote Newcomers Feedback Session (online, scheduled in coming weeks)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IETF Mission</strong>: To &quot;make the internet work better&quot; by producing high-quality, technically relevant documents. The IETF influences how the internet is designed, used, and managed (e.g., Drone Remote Identification Protocol - DRIP).</li>
<li><strong>IETF as an SDO</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Unique model: Membership is individual-based and self-selected (via DataTracker), not country-based or paid.</li>
<li>Consensus: Operates on &quot;rough consensus and running code,&quot; meaning all dissenting opinions are heard but not controlling. No formal voting.</li>
<li>Funding: Primarily supported by the Internet Society, grants, and corporate contributions for sustainability, diversity, and meeting hosting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IETF Structure</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>IESG (Internet Engineering Steering Group)</strong>: Composed of Area Directors (ADs), responsible for technical direction, approving Working Group (WG) charters, and meeting decisions.</li>
<li><strong>IRTF (Internet Research Task Force)</strong>: Focuses on longer-term research, co-located with IETF meetings; attendees can participate in IRTF sessions.</li>
<li><strong>IAB (Internet Architecture Board)</strong>: Provides architectural oversight, manages liaison relationships with other organizations (e.g., ISO, ITU, Unicode Consortium), and organizes workshops (e.g., upcoming on sustainability).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IETF Areas</strong>: The technical work is organized into seven main areas, each overseeing multiple working groups.</li>
<li><strong>Rough Consensus and Humming</strong>: Consensus is achieved through open discussion. &quot;Humming&quot; is a documented technique (RFC) used in meetings to quickly gauge consensus on an issue, with participants humming &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; or &quot;can't decide.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Meeting Week Overview (Hybrid Model)</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Working Group Sessions</strong>: Core of the meeting (Monday-Friday), where technical work and document progression occur.</li>
<li><strong>Birds of a Feather (BoFs)</strong>: Exploratory sessions to gauge interest for potential new working groups.</li>
<li><strong>Area-Wide Sessions</strong>: Updates from WGs within a specific area; &quot;Dispatch&quot; sessions guide new work to appropriate WGs or to form new ones.</li>
<li><strong>Plenary</strong>: Administrative session for updates from IESG, IAB, IETF LLC (finances), Nominating Committee.</li>
<li><strong>Social Event</strong>: Scheduled at Barnes Museum.</li>
<li><strong>IRTF/ANRW</strong>: Research sessions, including the Advanced Network and Research Workshop (ANRW, an ACM workshop) and presentations of the Applied Networking Research Prize (ANRP).</li>
<li><strong>Hackathon</strong>: (Held pre-IETF meeting, yesterday/today) Collaborative coding to implement and test IETF specifications, fostering interoperability.</li>
<li><strong>Tutorials/Deep Dives</strong>: Specialized technical presentations (e.g., on QUIC).</li>
<li><strong>Side Meetings</strong>: Informal gatherings for specific discussions, not officially streamed.</li>
<li><strong>Hallway Track</strong>: Informal discussions and networking during breaks, a crucial part of in-person meetings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Working Group Session Mechanics</strong>: Most work happens on mailing lists. Meeting presentations focus on &quot;diffs&quot; (changes since last meeting) and open issues. Sessions are streamed and recorded on MeetEcho and later on YouTube. WGs operate under a charter negotiated with ADs.</li>
<li><strong>Meeting Etiquette</strong>: Read documents in advance, use the Zulip chat system for back-channel discussion or clarification, be respectful, speak slowly, and state your name at the microphone.</li>
<li><strong>Bringing New Work</strong>: Ideas can start as Internet-Drafts (IDs), submitted through the DataTracker (authors.ietf.org provides tooling and tutorials). Initial discussions can happen informally before a BoF.</li>
<li><strong>IETF Culture</strong>: Described as passionate, vocal, informal, valuing technical excellence. Efforts are ongoing to improve inclusivity and foster a positive environment.</li>
<li><strong>Support and Resources</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-Harassment Policy &amp; Ombuds Team</strong>: Multiple avenues for addressing concerns, starting with WG Chairs/ADs, up to the IETF Chair, and the independent Ombuds Team (three long-term participants).</li>
<li><strong>IETF Secretariat</strong>: Staff managing logistics, registration, and general support.</li>
<li><strong>RFC Editor &amp; IANA Staff</strong>: Key functions present at meetings (with office hours) for document publication and protocol number assignments, respectively.</li>
<li><strong>IETF Sisters</strong>: An informal support group for women and non-binary individuals in the IETF, with networking events and a mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>DataTracker (dt.ietf.org)</strong>: The central and most critical resource for all IETF activities, containing WG information, documents, meeting materials, mailing list archives, and a bug reporting system. The Tools Team (Code Sprint) actively develops and maintains it.</li>
<li><strong>MeetEcho</strong>: The custom web-based conferencing system for managing sessions, queues, and recordings.</li>
<li><strong>IETF Network</strong>: A dedicated, deployed network for meeting attendees, with help desk support available.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Resources</strong>: Newcomer email links, &quot;The Tao of the IETF,&quot; main meeting mailing lists, and <code>support@ietf.org</code> for all meeting issues (a ticketing system).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
