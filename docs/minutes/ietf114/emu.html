<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 27 Jul 2022 19:00</p>
<h1>emu</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The emu working group session at IETF 114 covered updates on several EAP-related drafts. The TLS-based EAP type and EAP Forward Secrecy drafts are progressing towards Working Group Last Call. A proposal for EAP-DPP onboarding, utilizing existing TLS mechanisms and RFC 9258 (External PSK Importer), was presented and is ready for an adoption call. The EAP Ad Hoc draft, which focuses on a compact, lightweight authenticated key exchange for constrained scenarios, requested adoption but requires further review and charter evaluation. A new draft proposing unauthenticated EAP-TLS for Brewski onboarding was introduced, prompting discussion on server authentication and its scope. The session concluded with a discussion on potential future work areas and charter adjustments, including certificate usage guidance and EAP for constrained radio networks.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>TLS-based EAP Type (draft-ietf-emu-eap-tls-eap-type):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The document is considered stable, with no known open issues or implementation challenges beyond specific vendor choices.</li>
<li>One implementation chose not to support New Session Ticket for EAP-TLS, which can increase backend database load due to full re-authentication for every session.</li>
<li>Multiple client and server implementations exist and interoperate.</li>
<li>All prior review comments have been addressed. The document is believed to be ready for advancement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EAP Forward Secrecy (draft-ietf-emu-eap-tls-pfs):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The draft is considered ready, with the latest version clarifying the encoding of cryptographic values.</li>
<li>Emphasizes significant security improvements, particularly against pervasive surveillance, by providing forward secrecy.</li>
<li>Recommendations include migrating existing systems to use this method.</li>
<li>Revised warning regarding issues with smart cards, focusing on supply chain manufacturing and key provisioning.</li>
<li>The public value encoding, previously discussed, aligns with 3GPP 5G specifications and open-source cryptographic libraries, supporting the current text.</li>
<li>The document is now ready for a Working Group Last Call.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EAP-DPP Onboarding (draft-harkins-emu-eap-dpp-onboarding):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Addresses the &quot;onboarding catch-22&quot; for wired networks by reusing Wi-Fi DPP bootstrapping mechanisms and ECC key pair formats.</li>
<li>Utilizes HKDF to derive a pre-shared key (PSK) from a public bootstrap key.</li>
<li>Performs server-based EAP with external PSK addition to TLS, and raw public key authentication for the client.</li>
<li>A key change from previous versions is the adoption of RFC 9258 (External PSK Importer) instead of an earlier &quot;extensible PSKs&quot; draft, eliminating the need for new TLS extensions or key schedule changes.</li>
<li>The PSK is intended for single use; once a device is onboarded and has a certificate, the bootstrapping key is not reused unless the device is factory reset.</li>
<li>The draft has received extensive review from the TLS working group.</li>
<li>Running code exists, with efforts to integrate with OpenSSL's RFC 7250 support.</li>
<li>The draft is considered stable and aligned with the working group charter item for bootstrapping keying material.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EAP Ad Hoc (draft-martinez-emu-eap-ad-hoc):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A new version with additional co-authors, incorporating feedback from the mailing list.</li>
<li>Proposes a compact and lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange over COSE (Ad Hoc) for constrained scenarios, providing mutual authentication, forward secrecy, and identity protection.</li>
<li>Key updates include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy-Friendly Response Identity:</strong> Requirement to avoid permanent identifiers in clear text, recommending anonymous realms or unencrypted identities.</li>
<li><strong>Fragmentation Support:</strong> Similar to EAP-TLS, using flags for request/response fragmentation.</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Indication:</strong> Mandates the use of Ad Hoc message 4 for alternative success indication.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Defined specific error messages for incorrect processing of Ad Hoc messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The authors believe the draft is mature and ready for adoption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EAP Unauthenticated TLS Onboarding (draft-mglt-emu-eap-unauth-tls-onboarding):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Aims to solve a &quot;Brewski&quot; onboarding problem where an unconfigured device needs to join a captive portal network using unauthenticated EAP-TLS (as per RFC 5216).</li>
<li>Proposes explicit signaling via <code>eep.arpa</code> as an EAP identity, indicating a client's desire for a captive portal and lack of initial credentials. This signal cannot be forwarded or proxied.</li>
<li>The device would authenticate the server using a CA root, leveraging existing web PKI.</li>
<li>Compares to vendor-specific TLS types in Wi-Fi Alliance Hotspot 2.0, seeking to bring this functionality into the IETF.</li>
<li>Discussion points included:
<ul>
<li>Concerns about using web CA roots for onboarding due to different due diligence requirements for web browsing vs. network service provider identity.</li>
<li>Clarification that <code>eep.arpa</code> signifies &quot;I have no idea who I am, I want a captive portal&quot; in IoT/Brewski contexts.</li>
<li>The relationship with Brewski's own network authentication mechanisms, suggesting Brewski could handle &quot;wrong network&quot; problems, potentially simplifying the EAP-TLS exchange to focus purely on IP connectivity.</li>
<li>The draft intends to focus on EAP layer changes, with Brewski protocols running over full IP connectivity as a subsequent step.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The draft was published just before the cutoff; further elaboration and address of concerns are planned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Working Group Future Direction / Charter Discussion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion on expanding the charter to cover new areas given the progress on current chartered items.</li>
<li>Potential areas of interest raised:
<ul>
<li>Allen's other EAP document on discovery and configuration using OIDs in certificates and SRV records.</li>
<li>The possibility of a new password-based EAP method using C-PACE (as EAP-PWD is informational and uses an older Dragonfly variant).</li>
<li>Need for more guidance and requirements on using certificates and their configuration in EAP, and EAP in constrained radio networks (supported by John Torren).</li>
<li>Update on Friedrich's <code>eap-outer</code> draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
