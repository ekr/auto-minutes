<h1>stir</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The STIR working group reviewed the status and discussed open issues for several drafts: Rich Call Data (RCD), Messaging, Error Handling, and OCSP for STIR Certificates. The RCD and Messaging drafts were deemed ready for advancement to the IESG and shepherd write-up, respectively, after addressing minor editorial and normative points. The Error Handling draft requires further revisions based on discussions regarding cause codes and <code>Reason</code> header handling. For the OCSP draft, the working group decided to proceed with defining terminating-side OCSP queries first, deferring the more complex stapling mechanism. A brief discussion on Connected Identity (RFC 4916 update) highlighted its current challenges.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<h3>Rich Call Data (RCD)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document Status</strong>: Draft <code>stir-rich-call-data-04</code> (version 19) was released with mostly editorial changes between versions 17 and 19.</li>
<li><strong>Normative Language Change</strong>: A <code>MUST</code> was changed to <code>SHOULD</code> in the security considerations regarding the expectation for ecosystems to have vetting policies. This was debated, with some concern about making normative requirements on ecosystems but general agreement that <code>SHOULD</code> was acceptable.</li>
<li><strong>Grammatical Review</strong>: A specific sentence was identified as grammatically unclear.</li>
<li><strong>Path Forward</strong>: The working group agreed to send version 19 to the Area Director (AD) as soon as possible, prioritizing implementation over delaying for minor editorial corrections.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Messaging</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document Status</strong>: Draft <code>stir-messaging-04</code> (released yesterday) proposes repurposing STIR certification systems for text and multimedia messaging, scoped to telephone numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Motivation</strong>: Address message spam, especially in encrypted messaging contexts where Bayesian analysis is difficult.</li>
<li><strong>Working Group Last Call (WGLC) Feedback</strong>: Comments from a shorter WGLC were discussed.</li>
<li><strong><code>msgi</code> Parameter Scope</strong>: Discussion centered on whether the <code>msgi</code> (message integrity) hash parameter should be allowed in passport types other than <code>message</code> passports.
<ul>
<li>Concerns were raised about potential confusion and polymorphism if <code>msgi</code> appeared in <code>SHAKEN</code> or <code>RCD</code> passports, leading to potential misinterpretation by verifiers.</li>
<li>A suggestion to disallow <code>msgi</code> in non-message passports for Authentication Services (AS) and mandate verifiers (VS) to ignore it if encountered was broadly accepted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Out-of-Band&quot; (OOB) Definition</strong>: Clarification was sought regarding the broad applicability of OOB mechanisms (non-SIP, e.g., HTTP services adjacent to SMS/WhatsApp) for messaging. The working group found the broad scope acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Error Handling</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document Changes</strong>:
<ul>
<li><code>ppt</code> (passport type) changed to <code>ppi</code> (passport identifier).</li>
<li>Compact form recommended over full form due to security concerns regarding information leakage (originating/destination numbers) when full passports go upstream.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Announcing <code>Reason</code> Header Support</strong>: The proposal to announce support for the <code>Reason</code> header specific to STIR was discussed. No precedent exists in SIP, and implicit signaling was considered unhelpful. Consensus was to not include this.</li>
<li><strong>Dependency on <code>multiple-reasons</code> Draft</strong>: Paul Wouters suggested waiting for the <code>multiple-reasons</code> draft to reach WGLC. The group disagreed, citing existing mechanisms for normative dependencies and the <code>multiple-reasons</code> draft's expected progress.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Implications of <code>Reason</code> Codes</strong>: Discussion touched on privacy implications of verbose explanations in <code>Reason</code> codes. The group believed the recommendation for compact form mitigates the identified privacy issues.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Cause Codes</strong>: The draft considered being more explicit about using multiple error cause codes or constraining to a single one per <code>ppi</code>. RFC 8224 primarily intended cause codes for repairable conditions. Given the complexity of cascading errors in orchestrated services, the group leaned towards restricting to a single cause code for simplicity.</li>
<li><strong>Removing <code>Reason</code> Header vs. <code>ppi</code> Parameter</strong>: For full-form passports, the question was whether to remove the entire <code>Reason</code> header or just the <code>ppi</code> parameter. Concerns were raised that if only <code>ppi</code> is removed, the remaining <code>Reason</code> header might be meaningless or misleading to upstream elements not aware of STIR. The group generally agreed that the entire <code>Reason</code> header should be removed in such cases.</li>
<li><strong>STIR-Specific Cause Codes</strong>: Discussion on whether to only allow STIR-specific cause codes (e.g., from RFC 8224 and future STIR-related specs) or other SIP/Q.850 codes. Consensus was to focus on STIR-specific codes, with future STIR specifications explicitly stating if their codes fall into this category. It was also suggested to clarify that these <code>Reason</code> headers are for consumption by and presumed repairable by the Authentication Service.</li>
</ul>
<h3>OCSP for STIR Certificates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: RFC 8226 STIR certificates contain <code>tnAuthList</code> (service provider codes or telephone numbers). Telephone number ownership is dynamic, making long-lived certificates problematic if numbers are baked in directly. OCSP provides a real-time check for TN validity within a cert's scope.</li>
<li><strong>Revisiting OCSP</strong>: A previous OCSP draft, initially a child of 8226, had languished. It's being revisited due to growing enterprise delegation use cases where large, dynamic number ranges are managed.</li>
<li><strong>Major Open Issue: Stapling vs. Terminating Side Query</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Stapling</strong>: Originating side (AS) pre-fetches OCSP responses and sends them with the passport. Offers privacy benefits (VS doesn't query CA directly) and potential performance gains.</li>
<li><strong>Terminating Side Query</strong>: Verification Service (VS) directly queries the OCSP responder/CA.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal</strong>: Start by defining the terminating side query (standard OCSP) and defer stapling.</li>
<li><strong>Arguments for deferral</strong>: Easier to implement, less heavy lift for AS, similar benefits might be achieved with short-lived certificates (ACME).</li>
<li><strong>Arguments against deferral</strong>: Jack voiced concern that without stapling, OCSP might offer few benefits over existing caching, as the VS would still incur an RTT for every verification. Jonathan Peterson raised a privacy concern that terminating-side queries could leak calling numbers to CAs/OCSP responders.</li>
<li><strong>Consensus</strong>: A show of hands indicated broad support (8:2) for initially specifying OCSP without stapling. The group acknowledged the complexity of stapling and its similarity to short-lived certs, which are being explored separately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Non-Critical Extensions in RFC 8226</strong>: Jack asked why <code>tnAuthList</code> and other STIR-specific extensions in RFC 8226 are non-critical. The original assumption was that entities interacting with STIR certs would inherently be part of the curated ecosystem and understand these extensions. An update would require a focused revision, for which no volunteers stepped forward.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Any Other Business (AOB)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connected Identity (RFC 4916 Update)</strong>: This draft, aiming to provide identity in SIP responses, was acknowledged as important but &quot;clunky.&quot; Challenges include SIP's restriction of passports to requests, necessitating complex mechanisms like PRACK and early media. The group noted the need for a more practical approach or reconsideration of the SIP model for this.</li>
<li>The discussion on Connected Identity was eventually moved to offline channels due to its complexity and time constraints.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>RCD</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Send draft <code>stir-rich-call-data-04</code> (version 19) to the IESG for AD review.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: Authors to send IPR statement to the chairs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Messaging</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision</strong>: <code>msgi</code> parameter must be scoped only to <code>message</code> passport types. Authentication Services (AS) are disallowed from including <code>msgi</code> in non-message passports. Verification Services (VS) <em>must ignore</em> <code>msgi</code> if found in non-message passports.</li>
<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Draft <code>stir-messaging-04</code> is ready for shepherd write-up.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: Billy to incorporate the <code>msgi</code> scoping language into the draft.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: John Peterson to shepherd the <code>stir-messaging</code> draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Restrict to a single cause code for each <code>ppi</code> for simplicity and alignment with RFC 8224.</li>
<li><strong>Decision</strong>: When full form <code>ppi</code> is present and needs protection, the entire <code>Reason</code> header should be removed, not just the <code>ppi</code> parameter.</li>
<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Clarify that <code>Reason</code> headers are intended for consumption by the Authentication Service and are presumably repairable by it.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: Chris to make the agreed changes to the error handling draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>OCSP</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision</strong>: Initially specify OCSP for STIR certificates focusing on the terminating-side query mechanism, deferring stapling for later consideration.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: Chairs to identify reviewers for the <code>stir-ocsp-certs</code> draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>RCD</strong>: Await Area Director review.</li>
<li><strong>Messaging</strong>: John Peterson to complete the shepherd write-up for <code>stir-messaging-04</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: After Chris implements the agreed changes, the revised draft will undergo another round of list discussion/review before proceeding to Working Group Last Call.</li>
<li><strong>OCSP</strong>: Reviewers are requested to examine the <code>stir-ocsp-certs</code> draft. Following review and resolution of comments, the draft will proceed to Working Group Last Call.</li>
<li><strong>Connected Identity</strong>: Continue discussions offline to explore alternative approaches given the complexities of the current SIP-based mechanism.</li>
