<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 27 Jul 2022 14:00</p>
<h1>ntp Session</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The ntp working group met with a light agenda, primarily focusing on document status updates, administrative items, and planning for future work. The YANG data model has been published, while &quot;Interleave Modes&quot; and &quot;Mode 6 Commands&quot; are in IESG stages. A Working Group Last Call (WGLC) was issued for the &quot;Chronos&quot; document. A key discussion revolved around changing the &quot;Update Registries&quot; document to Standards Track, necessitating a short WGLC. For the &quot;PTP Enterprise Profile&quot;, approval from IEEE has been received, and a strategy for handling the &quot;master/slave&quot; terminology (referencing ongoing IEEE 1588 work) was adopted. The working group decided to proceed with Calls for Adoption for both the NTPv5 protocol draft and the NTP over PTP draft. A new discussion point regarding supporting local time in NTPv5 was raised and deferred to the mailing list. The chairs announced plans for monthly virtual interims and a potential hackathon for &quot;Rough Time&quot; at IETF 115.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Administrative</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Reminder of IETF Notewell and meeting etiquette (masking, mic queue, audio/video off for remote participants not speaking).</li>
<li>Scribe and Jabber scribe were present; note-taking encouraged on the shared notepad.</li>
<li>Agenda was light, with a plan to schedule monthly virtual interim meetings to maintain progress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Working Group Document Status</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>NTP Yang Data Model</strong>: Published.</li>
<li><strong>Interleave Modes</strong> and <strong>Mode 6 Commands</strong>: Currently in IESG stages.</li>
<li><strong>Chronos</strong>: Working Group Last Call (WGLC) was issued. Working Group members are urged to review and provide comments on the mailing list to demonstrate consensus.</li>
<li><strong>Update Registries</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Previously passed WGLC and was ready for IESG.</li>
<li>Following a review, the document's type was questioned (Informational vs. Standards Track).</li>
<li>Given it updates a Standards Track document, it was decided to switch this document to Standards Track.</li>
<li>A very short WGLC will be performed specifically for this change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>PTP Enterprise Profile</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Approval from IEEE to share the underlying specification for review has been received.</li>
<li>Addresses terminology issues (e.g., &quot;master clocks&quot; and &quot;slave clocks&quot;) from IEEE 1588. The current IETF draft will use 1588 terminology with a note that 1588 is actively working on updating this language. The IETF document is a profile of 1588, so it will follow 1588's language, assuming the IETF draft will be published before the 1588 terminology update is finalized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Specific Document Discussions</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>NTPv5 Use Cases and Requirements (<code>draft-ietf-ntp-ntpv5-use-cases-requirements</code>)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>James published -00 with editorial changes.</li>
<li>Working Group review requested.</li>
<li>Question raised by Dieter about considering RFC 7384 (TickTock security requirements) in Section 5. James was not aware of it and will review it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rough Time</strong>:
<ul>
<li>No updates to the document.</li>
<li>Interest in implementation experiments and a potential hackathon effort for IETF 115.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>NTPv5 Protocol (<code>draft-mlichvar-ntp-ntpv5</code>)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Discussion on meeting the requirements document.</li>
<li>James indicated five outstanding issues from a previous analysis (ossification, minimizing abuse capability, no notifications, connection reestablishment), but these are not considered insurmountable.</li>
<li>Decision to proceed with a Call for Adoption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>NTP over PTP (<code>draft-mlichvar-ntp-ntp-over-ptp</code>)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Miroslav suggested a Call for Adoption.</li>
<li>Noted a potential issue with the <code>sequence id</code> field (currently specified as always zero) that might conflict with some drivers. This would need to be addressed.</li>
<li>Decision to proceed with a Call for Adoption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>NTS for PTP</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Two proposals exist, with primary advocates intending to merge them into a single approach. This has not yet occurred, and one author is currently busy with graduate studies.</li>
<li>No updates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Other Business</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>NTPv5 Local Time Support</strong>: Miroslav proposed supporting local time (instead of UTC) in NTPv5 to simplify client logic for small embedded computers. This could be controversial.</li>
<li>Discussion indicated it's worth exploring use cases and implications. Decision to move the discussion to the mailing list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<p><strong>Decisions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>draft-ietf-ntp-update-registries</code> document will be changed from Informational to Standards Track. A very short Working Group Last Call (WGLC) will be issued specifically for this change.</li>
<li>The working group will proceed with a Call for Adoption for <code>draft-mlichvar-ntp-ntpv5</code> (NTPv5 protocol specification).</li>
<li>The working group will proceed with a Call for Adoption for <code>draft-mlichvar-ntp-ntp-over-ptp</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action Items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working Group Members</strong>: Review the <code>chronos</code> WGLC and provide comments on the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>James</strong>: Review RFC 7384 (&quot;Security Requirements for Time Protocols in IETF&quot;) and consider its implications for <code>draft-ietf-ntp-ntpv5-use-cases-requirements</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Miroslav</strong>: Initiate a discussion on the ntp mailing list regarding supporting &quot;Alternative Time Scale for NTPv5&quot; (e.g., local time).</li>
<li><strong>Chairs</strong>: Schedule monthly virtual interims for the ntp working group.</li>
<li><strong>Chairs/WG</strong>: Explore planning a hackathon effort for &quot;Rough Time&quot; in conjunction with IETF 115.</li>
<li><strong>Chairs</strong>: Monitor progress of drafts and virtual interims to decide on requesting agenda time for IETF 115.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Issue a short WGLC for <code>draft-ietf-ntp-update-registries</code> to confirm the change to Standards Track.</li>
<li>Issue Calls for Adoption for <code>draft-mlichvar-ntp-ntpv5</code> and <code>draft-mlichvar-ntp-ntp-over-ptp</code>.</li>
<li>Convene monthly virtual interim meetings to progress existing drafts and new work items.</li>
<li>Actively engage in the mailing list discussion regarding NTPv5 local time support.</li>
<li>Primary authors of NTS for PTP are encouraged to merge their proposals.</li>
</ul>
