<h1>Hot RFC Lightning Talks</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This session featured a series of lightning talks on a diverse range of current and emerging technical topics relevant to the IETF community. Speakers presented on green networking and sustainability, post-quantum cryptography challenges, the Internet of Secure Elements, attestation in TLS, LEO satellite networking, secure WebRTC, operations and control networks, enterprise security implications of ECH, data-driven network optimization, Multicast QUIC, and network latency. Each presentation highlighted technical problems, proposed solutions, existing work, and called for community engagement and collaboration.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>What Has the IETF Ever Done for Energy? (Torsten)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Presented a document surveying IETF's contributions to energy saving, both incidental (e.g., efficiency from digitized solutions, internet scale) and specific (e.g., low-power networks, smart grids, E-MAN working group).</li>
<li>Aimed to educate the community, foster interest in new work, and broaden technology adoption.</li>
<li>Invited community feedback and contributions to the document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Challenges and Opportunities in Green Networking (Alexander)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Built on the previous talk, emphasizing sustainability as a grand challenge and the network's role.</li>
<li>Identified opportunities and challenges at four levels:
<ul>
<li><strong>Device/Equipment</strong>: Need for proper instrumentation and visibility into energy metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Protocol</strong>: Traffic adaptation, energy-friendly traffic characteristics, fast discovery for dynamic resource management, efficient network addressing.</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong>: Energy-aware routing, control protocol extensions for sustainable path configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Architecture</strong>: Energy-conscious placement of content and computation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introduced two drafts: a problem statement and a specific draft on metrics and instrumentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Challenges and Opportunities of Post-Quantum Cryptography (Sophia)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Highlighted NIST's selection of post-quantum algorithms for key exchange and digital signatures, marking a critical milestone.</li>
<li>Noted that PQ algorithms often have larger parameter sizes and/or higher computational times, impacting network latency and protocols.</li>
<li>Discussed the lack of traditional Diffie-Hellman properties in many PQ algorithms and the challenges for protocols like TLS, WireGuard, and Signal.</li>
<li>Mentioned the IETF PPQM (Post-Quantum Messaging) group and the need for generic designs and potential protocol changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Internet of Security Elements (IoSE) (Pascal)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Focused on connecting secure elements (e.g., smart cards, SIMs, e-passports) to the internet as online cryptographic resources identifiable by URIs.</li>
<li>Identified challenges including the lack of a TCP/IP stack in secure elements, requiring additional processors.</li>
<li>Outlined the need for defined protocols to access secure element resources, naming conventions, and attestation procedures.</li>
<li>Presented three IETF drafts: ROX (Global Platform over TLS), TLS-SC (TLS PSK in secure element), and IoSE (attestation procedures).</li>
<li>Mentioned open-source software implementations available for these concepts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Attestation within TLS (Hannes)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Addressed the need for device attestation (e.g., genuineness, configuration, running software) in IoT device enrollment with cloud services, as explored by the RATS (Remote ATtestation procedures) working group.</li>
<li>Proposed integrating attestation with TLS by augmenting the TLS exchange with attestation information and providing proof of possession.</li>
<li>Described a software solution combining embedTLS (TLS 1.3), a platform-agnostic security hardware library (BASIC), and a cloud verification service (Veriza).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>LEO Satellite Networking: Flying Infrastructure for Future Internet (Lynn Hahn)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Emphasized LEO satellites as key components of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) due to low latency, high bandwidth, and global coverage.</li>
<li>Detailed unique challenges: high-speed satellite movement causing interleaved mesh networks, rapid link flipping with ground stations, and dynamic inter-satellite distances.</li>
<li>Argued for IP networking in LEO for scalability, internet interworking, and alignment with 3GPP expectations, despite existing non-IP solutions.</li>
<li>Highlighted current IP technology limitations in addressing, routing, traffic engineering, multipath, and mobility for LEO.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Secure Open Standards for WebRTC (Phil)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Critiqued the current state of WebRTC where open standards are often hidden behind proprietary &quot;walled gardens.&quot;</li>
<li>Advocated for user control over communication (provider choice, address portability, not using phone numbers for messaging).</li>
<li>Stressed the need for security beyond basic end-to-end packet encryption, addressing vulnerabilities in contacts directories and single-vendor applications that can be exploited by hostile entities.</li>
<li>Proposed completing the messaging stack by integrating a Threshold Key Infrastructure (TKI) with WebRTC, allowing users to control contacts and choose application providers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Challenges and Opportunities in Operations and Control Networks (OCN) (Lee Jindong)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Presented the rising need for sophisticated, flexible, and interoperable controllers in automated factories and remote driving scenarios, often involving cloud-based virtualization.</li>
<li>Defined OCN as the interconnection of devices and controllers for data exchange, monitoring, and causing changes to end equipment, requiring guaranteed end-to-end latency and urgent packet prioritization.</li>
<li>Identified key issues: using IP for controller-to-field device interconnection, high-precision communication, granular QoS, media diversity (5G, Ethernet), field bus protocol conversion, addressing (auto-configuration, header compression), message types, and security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ECH for Enterprises: Operational Security Concerns (Arnaud)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussed the impact of Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) on enterprise operational security, particularly the removal of SNI access, which pushes security to the endpoint.</li>
<li>Raised concerns about the trustworthiness of client devices and browsers for security controls (e.g., data loss prevention, attack detection), as they cannot be both &quot;judge and party.&quot;</li>
<li>Questioned whether ECH shifts the security model to cloud-facing servers, potentially reintroducing a &quot;middlebox&quot; problem.</li>
<li>Called for clarification on client-facing server protocols and methods for integrating third-party security components.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data-Driven Approach to Tackle Network Diversity with Heterogeneous Protocol Configurations (Gusama)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Highlighted that Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) typically use homogeneous protocol configurations (e.g., TCP, HTTP) for all users, despite significant user and network diversity.</li>
<li>Presented measurements showing up to 70% improvement in page load times by using optimal, connection-specific configurations.</li>
<li>Proposed a system with two components: a data path (modified networking stack at the server for flexible, per-connection reconfiguration) and a global control path (using algorithms and machine learning to predict optimal configurations).</li>
<li>Advocated for investing in flexible networking stack architectures that dynamically adapt to user conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Multicast QUIC (Jake)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Addressed the problem of unicast for certain applications and proposed using IP multicast with QUIC.</li>
<li>Described the basic idea: a single unicast connection, server tells client to join multicast channels, client sends ACKs, and multicast is server-to-client only, aligning with SECDISPATCH 112 security considerations.</li>
<li>Seeking to develop a prototype and gather feedback on the draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Network Latency: Why it Matters, How to Measure it, What to Do About it (Stuart)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Argued that latency, not just throughput, is crucial for most user experiences (e.g., apps, gaming, video seeking).</li>
<li>Introduced new measurement tools: Apple's in-app diagnostics showing &quot;round trips per minute,&quot; Waveform's bufferbloat test, and Ookla Speedtest's new &quot;working latency&quot; metric (how the network performs under load, not just idle).</li>
<li>Proposed L4S (Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput) as a solution, a congestion control method that keeps queues short at bottleneck links using ECN marks to reduce round-trip delay.</li>
<li>Referenced hackathon work and resources like the IETF BITAG report on latency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
