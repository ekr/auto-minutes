# iabopen

## Summary

The IAB Open session provided updates on IAB activities, ongoing programs, and upcoming workshops. Key discussions included the potential closure of the Internet Threat Model (MODEL T) program, the importance of a data minimization principle in protocol design, and an invited talk on the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) and its implications for internet architecture, competition, and technical implementation. Community input was actively sought on several topics, particularly regarding program directions and technical contributions to policy-driven mandates.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IAB Activity Updates:**
    *   One RFC published: New RFC Series Editor model.
    *   Two workshop reports: One in RFC Editor queue, one in community feedback.
    *   One technical "recommendations" document ready for community review.
    *   One "blockchain" related document (`draft-iab-protocol-maintenance`) under active discussion.
*   **EDM Program (Evolvability, Deployability, and Maintainability of Protocols):**
    *   Focus on improving protocol design and documentation, particularly `draft-iab-protocol-maintenance` (robustness principle).
    *   An interim meeting is scheduled for Thursday, 9-10 AM, to discuss this document, with a strong encouragement for community participation and feedback. The goal is to publish this document soon.
*   **MODEL T Program (Internet Threat Model Program):**
    *   The IAB is actively considering closing the program due to a lack of community engagement and the program not serving as the effective venue for broader discussion as intended.
    *   Concerns were raised by the community about closing the program, urging the IAB to inject energy or provide a clear plan for existing document contributions.
    *   The IAB acknowledged the community's frustration but suggested that a different venue (e.g., `architecture-discuss` mailing list, IRTF research groups like PRG or HRPC, or the SEC area) might be more appropriate for ongoing discussions and document progression.
*   **New IAB Internal Groups:**
    *   IETF and IEEE Coordination Group: Formalizing existing liaison work to increase visibility.
    *   IAB ISOC Policy Coordination Group: Intensifying the relationship with ISOC for focused discussion and coordination.
*   **Liaison Awareness Update (ITU-T):**
    *   Scott Mansfield provided a comprehensive overview of ITU-T activities, highlighting technical, policy, and geopolitical impacts.
    *   Key areas of ITU-T work mentioned: IMT-2020/5G transport, trust in quantum technologies, identity management, autonomous networks, machine learning data sets (new correspondence group for dataset transfer standardization).
    *   Significant ITU events include WTSA, WTDC, and the upcoming Plenipotentiary Meeting (a treaty-binding meeting in Bucharest) which will address internet governance, AAI, OpenRAN, and open standards.
*   **Upcoming IAB Workshops:**
    *   **Management Techniques and Encrypted Networks (Fall):** Call for position papers is out. Aims to improve management, security, and user privacy in encrypted networks.
    *   **Environmental Impacts of Internet Applications and Systems (December, virtual):** Call for papers coming soon. Focus on understanding impacts, appropriate metrics, and data analysis. Confirmed to include energy management and sustainability.
*   **Data Minimization Principle:**
    *   Yari M. proposed a "Data Minimization Principle" based on the principle of least privilege, stating that protocol participants should only share information necessary for a specific function.
    *   Examples of application include Oblivious DNS/HTTPS, Privacy-Preserving Measurements (PPM WG), and end-to-end message encryption.
    *   The proposed principle is intended as high-level guidance for protocol design, with further discussion invited on the `architecture-discuss` mailing list.
*   **EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) Invited Talk (Dr. Cabral):**
    *   The DMA, recently approved, aims to restore competition in digital markets dominated by "gatekeepers" (e.g., Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta).
    *   **Key provisions ("Do's and Don'ts"):**
        *   Prohibition of self-preferencing in ranking/indexing.
        *   Mandate for FRAND (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory) access to click and query data for third parties.
        *   Requirements for interoperability, particularly for messaging services and app stores.
        *   Restrictions on platform-level controls (e.g., preventing off-platform transactions).
        *   Mandates for data portability, allowing users to transfer their data to competing platforms.
        *   Notification requirements for acquisitions by gatekeepers.
    *   **Enforcement:** Significant fines (up to 10% of global turnover) and on-site inspection rights for the European Commission.
    *   **Implementation Challenges:** Acknowledged lack of technical expertise within the EU Commission, leading to a significant demand for technical input to address loopholes and effectively implement the DMA. The Digital Services Act (DSA) will address related issues like liability and free speech.
    *   **Community Concerns and Discussion:** Questions were raised regarding:
        *   Avoiding legal loopholes and companies circumventing rules (e.g., through changing definitions or proprietary encryption).
        *   The process and timeline for defining and achieving interoperability, with a suggestion for IETF/IAB involvement.
        *   Facilitating user mobility and data portability between platforms (switching costs).
        *   Whether the EC prefers standardized solutions over bilateral negotiations for interoperability.
        *   The potential for "liberalization of surveillance" through mandated data sharing (Dr. Cabral clarified this refers to user's right to their own data for portability, not general access).
        *   Mechanisms for revising the DMA and useful advocacy for future adjustments, recognizing the risks (e.g., impact on startups).

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision (Under Consideration):** The IAB is actively considering closing the MODEL T program.
*   **Action Item:** The community is strongly encouraged to provide feedback to the IAB regarding the potential closure of the MODEL T program and to identify alternative appropriate venues for ongoing discussions and related document contributions (e.g., `architecture-discuss` mailing list, relevant IRTF research groups, or IETF SEC area).
*   **Action Item:** All interested parties are encouraged to attend the EDM program's interim meeting on Thursday (9-10 AM in the IAB office) to provide feedback on `draft-iab-protocol-maintenance`.
*   **Action Item:** Submit position papers for the "Management Techniques and Encrypted Networks" workshop (Call for Papers is out).
*   **Action Item:** Watch out for the upcoming Call for Papers for the "Environmental Impacts of Internet Applications and Systems" workshop.
*   **Action Item:** IETF groups working on 5G or transport are requested to communicate their work to the ITU-T liaison manager (Scott Mansfield) to avoid duplication of effort.
*   **Action Item:** Further discussion on the proposed "Data Minimization Principle" document should take place on the `architecture-discuss` mailing list.
*   **Action Item:** The IETF and IAB communities are encouraged to engage with the European Commission and relevant bodies to provide technical expertise on the implementation of the Digital Markets Act, particularly concerning interoperability standards and data portability mechanisms.

## Next Steps

*   The `draft-iab-protocol-maintenance` document is expected to be published soon after community feedback.
*   The IAB will continue internal discussions on the future of the MODEL T program, taking community input into account.
*   The calls for position papers for both announced workshops are active or imminent.
*   Future IAB Open sessions will continue to provide liaison updates, expanding beyond ITU-T to other organizations for broader awareness and coordination.
*   The Digital Markets Act is now in effect, and its implementation, dialogues with gatekeepers, and potential revisions will unfold over the coming years.
