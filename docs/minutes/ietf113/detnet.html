<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 22 Mar 2022 13:30</p>
<h1>detnet</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The DetNet Working Group at IETF 113 discussed various aspects of deterministic networking, covering charter updates, milestone revisions, and a range of technical drafts. Key discussions included expanding the charter to encompass new traffic treatments, an ITU-T liaison report, the framework for DetNet control planes, OAM mechanisms for MPLS and IP, a packet ordering function, IPv6 data plane enhancements using extension headers, requirements for large-scale DetNet deployments, and specific queuing/forwarding solutions like Time-Sensitive Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (TCQF) and Deadline-based Forwarding. Additionally, discussions touched on one-way delay measurement without clock synchronization and PCE extensions for DetNet path computation. The chairs emphasized the contribution-driven nature of the WG and planned for adoption calls for requirements and solution documents in upcoming months.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opening &amp; Logistics</strong>: The session was held in a hybrid format, with a note on IETF policies, code of conduct, and tools (Meetecho for queue/blue sheets, Hedgedoc for notes). Two sessions were planned, one WG-specific and a joint session with PALS/MPLS.</li>
<li><strong>Charter Update</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Discussion focused on adding flexibility to the charter's traffic treatment clause, specifically for queuing and scheduling.</li>
<li>A proposal to add &quot;for example&quot; between &quot;including&quot; and &quot;forwarding&quot; was presented to allow for non-prescriptive listing of traffic treatments.</li>
<li>The AD (John Scudder) had no objection, noting it makes the intent clearer.</li>
<li>A question arose regarding coordination with SDOs like IEEE TSN for shared mechanisms; the chairs affirmed continued coordination while evaluating proposals based on specifics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Milestones Update</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Milestones were updated to reflect progress and an expanded scope, notably for OAM and data plane enhancements.</li>
<li>A correction was noted for the &quot;first OAM document&quot; entry, clarifying it's not specific to &quot;IP OAM.&quot;</li>
<li>The &quot;enhanced DetNet data plane requirements&quot; milestone was clarified to cover requirements for new queuing mechanisms and solutions, stemming from discussions with the Transport Area AD.</li>
<li>The WG confirmed its contribution-driven approach, allowing for multiple requirements and solution documents if merited, rather than a single document per area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ITU-T SG13/Q6 Liaison Report (Scott Mansfield)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Reviewed liaison activity between IETF and ITU-T SG13/Q6 (QoS and QoE, large-scale networks, resource control).</li>
<li>Highlighted ITU-T's focus on &quot;large-scale networks&quot; and &quot;inter-domain networks,&quot; looking at use cases, frameworks, and architectures for 2030 and beyond, often from a top-down perspective.</li>
<li>Emphasized the importance of terminology alignment between SDOs.</li>
<li>Mentioned key ITU-T documents related to functional architecture, jitter guarantee, and QoS requirements for IMT-2020 (5G) and beyond.</li>
<li>Encouraged IETF participation in ITU-T meetings as invited experts to identify gaps and foster collaboration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>DetNet Controller Plane Framework (Shusang Li)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Document aims to consolidate DetNet control plane requirements and provide an overview of control architecture (fully distributed, fully centralized SDN-like, hybrid).</li>
<li>Covers considerations for various DetNet mechanisms (explicit paths, resource reservation, POF) and data plane solutions (MPLS, IP, SR).</li>
<li>Updates included refining management plan specifications and removing detailed protocol extension examples.</li>
<li>Discussion points: Integration with RAW architecture (Pascal Thubert, Carlos Pignataro suggested specific proposals on the mailing list); inclusion of TSN control plane protocols (Toerless Eckert suggested QCC reference).</li>
<li>Authors requested more WG input on flow aggregation and management plan scope (YANG, OAM).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>DetNet MPLS OAM (Greg Mirsky)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Presented updates to the DetNet ACH definition, differentiating it from pseudo-wire ACH with a new version number, sequence number, channel type, node ID, flags, and session identifier.</li>
<li>Coordination with PALS/MPLS OAM design team was confirmed.</li>
<li>Proposed an IANA registry for DetNet MPLS OAM flags.</li>
<li>Discussion on the encoding and mechanism of OAM packets; specific usage of fields like &quot;session ID&quot; needs further definition.</li>
<li>Concern raised that the document might not be ready for a Working Group Last Call (WGLC) due to unaddressed mechanism discussions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>DetNet IP OAM (Greg Mirsky)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Document describes active OAM for DetNet IP using UDP encapsulation, mapping to monitor the DetNet flow.</li>
<li>For DetNet service sub-layer realization, it proposes using MPLS over UDP for OAM to ensure fate-sharing with the DetNet flow.</li>
<li>Lou Berger emphasized the need for a solution that works for native IP (6-tuple flows) without MPLS encapsulation, suggesting this document or another should cover it.</li>
<li>Pascal Thubert suggested using IPv6 extension headers (Hub-by-Hop, SRH, Destination Option) for native IP OAM, similar to MPLS encapsulation, to signal path and treatment independent of application flows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Packet Ordering Function (POF) (Janos Farkas)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Document describes algorithms for POF in the DetNet service sub-layer to address out-of-order packet delivery caused by replication and elimination.</li>
<li>The draft is stable, focusing on algorithms, with delay variation aspects considered out of scope for this document.</li>
<li>The authors are seeking WG adoption.</li>
<li>Toerless Eckert suggested the ultimate goal should be a normative YANG document for POF parameters and other service sub-layer functions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IP/IPv6 Data Plane Enhancements using Extension Headers (Pascal Thubert)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Proposal to use IPv6 extension headers (Hub-by-Hop, Destination Option, SRH) as a network construct to carry path and treatment information, independent of application flow 5-tuple.</li>
<li>This approach aims to enable transport of multiple flow types (data, OAM) and aggregated flows with shared fate, similar to MPLS.</li>
<li>Emphasized the advantage of Hub-by-Hop headers being processed close to the IPv6 header, potentially enabling hardware processing.</li>
<li>Discussion on the guarantee of HBH header processing in a limited domain (DetNet scope) vs. the global internet, and interworking with SRH.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Large Scale DetNet Requirements (Fan Yang)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Document motivated by prototyping and trials of large-scale deterministic networks.</li>
<li>New requirements added: support for configuration of multiple queuing mechanisms and cross-domain mechanisms.</li>
<li>Overall technical requirements include time synchronization, propagation latency, high speed, numerous devices, massive traffic, and tolerance for failures/topology changes.</li>
<li>Potential data plane implications: IPv6 extension headers, redundancy/flow identification (e.g., for aggregation), and queue-related information.</li>
<li>The authors are requesting an adoption call for this document as the starting point for enhanced requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time-Sensitive Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (TCQF) (Toerless Eckert)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Highlighted limitations of existing bounded latency solutions (RFC 2212, TSN ATS, TSN cyclic queuing) for large-scale, high-speed networks.</li>
<li>Proposed TCQF as an enhanced cyclic queuing mechanism, carrying cycle identity in the packet, supporting arbitrary latency and high speeds (proven up to 100Gbps+).</li>
<li>The draft proposes standardizing TCQF with an MPLS forwarding plane using the traffic class field.</li>
<li>Adjacent work includes YANG models, ingress policing, and tagging for other data planes (e.g., DSCP, SRv6).</li>
<li>Question on adopting multiple data plane solutions vs. a generic one; the presenter advocated for multiple solutions based on deployment experience, suggesting TCQF is a good first candidate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reference Delay-Based One-Way Delay (OWD) Measurement (Bin Yang)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Proposed a method for accurate end-to-end OWD measurement without clock synchronization, leveraging a deterministic path (from DetNet) as a reference.</li>
<li>Method uses a reference packet and a target packet, with timestamps recorded at both ends, and equations to derive the target delay.</li>
<li>Benefits include reduced deployment cost and no impact on intermediate devices.</li>
<li>Concern raised about timer instability and skew without clock synchronization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deadline-based Forwarding (Xianfeng Li)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Proposed a solution for DetNet based on deadline attributes (Time-Dependent Delay Limit - TDL) for packet forwarding.</li>
<li>TDL attributes change with time, with TDL=0 having the highest priority.</li>
<li>Mechanism involves carrying TDL information in the packet and placing packets into queues based on TDL.</li>
<li>Benefits: No clock synchronization required, relative time operation, pragmatic enhancement of PQ, supports partial upgrades and scalability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>PCE-based Path Computation for DetNet (Shuanglong Chen)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Document describes extensions to PCE for carrying bounded latency constraints and distributing deterministic paths.</li>
<li>Proposed PCE extensions include a metric object for end-to-end delay/jitter, an IOSP extended flag TLV for deterministic path capability, and ERO/SRERO extensions for distributing path computation (e.g., DetNet sub-TLV, cycle sub-TLV).</li>
<li>Suggested that this work could be done in DetNet or PCE WG, and comments are welcome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
