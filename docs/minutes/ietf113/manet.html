<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 21 Mar 2022 12:00</p>
<h1>manet Session Minutes</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The manet working group meeting focused on two main items: reaching a decision on the future of the credit-based flow control documents, specifically whether to merge them as suggested by a TSV area review, and discussing the ongoing working group adoption call for D-LAB related drafts. The group decided to keep the credit-based flow control documents separate as originally structured and to extend adoption calls to all three D-LAB drafts to encourage broader discussion. Additionally, future work items including inter-satellite link routing and a practical application for Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) were discussed.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credit-Based Flow Control Documents:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Three credit-based flow control drafts had undergone TSV area review, receiving feedback which has been addressed in new versions.</li>
<li>The primary remaining point of discussion was a strong suggestion from reviewer David Black to merge the &quot;diff-serve aware credit extension&quot; and &quot;traffic classification&quot; drafts, citing potential clarity benefits for implementers.</li>
<li>The authors deferred to the working group's decision, as the WG had initially decided to split these documents for unambiguous conformance.</li>
<li>The chair noted that merging these two would impact a fourth draft (Ether-based credit flow control), potentially leading to two documents with significant content overlap and requiring extensive rework.</li>
<li>The AD indicated that from an IESG perspective, publishing them as one or four separate RFCs made little difference, provided they are properly cross-referenced and ideally published simultaneously. He emphasized that the reviewer's suggestion was not a blocking technical issue.</li>
<li>The long history of these documents and the need to progress them were highlighted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>D-LAB Related Drafts:</strong>
<ul>
<li>An adoption call is running for Henning Roger's &quot;D-LAB radio band parameters&quot; draft.</li>
<li>Discussion on the mailing list has touched upon how to represent frequency information for frequency-hopping radios.</li>
<li>Clarification was made that &quot;bandwidth&quot; in the context of the draft refers to spectral bandwidth (Hertz), not data throughput (bits per second).</li>
<li>The co-chair questioned why only one of the three related D-LAB drafts was under adoption call.</li>
<li>The chair agreed to issue adoption calls for all three D-LAB drafts to broaden discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Future Work - Inter-Satellite Links (ISL):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussion explored the potential role of the manet WG in routing over ISL, given its ad-hoc network characteristics.</li>
<li>It was noted that ISL work, encompassing mobility, routing, and potentially semantic addressing, is complex and spans multiple working groups (DMM, INT, RTGWG).</li>
<li>Interest was expressed in using ISL as a real-world use case for semantic routing discussions, which are also happening in IRTF (T2RG).</li>
<li>The AD, also an author on ISL drafts, expressed the need for broader community interest and participation from constellation providers to make standardization efforts fruitful at the IETF.</li>
<li>There was a suggestion to consolidate the routing aspects of ISL work into a single working group, with manet being a candidate due to available capacity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Future Work - Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF):</strong>
<ul>
<li>A presentation detailed a &quot;Duff&quot; (Deutsche American Freundschaft) conversion program developed to integrate NRL's SMF implementation (RFC 6621) with Henning Roger's OLSRv2 implementation (Olsrd2, RFC 7181).</li>
<li>The tool leverages OLSRv2's Multi-Point Relay (MPR) selection information for SMF's Source-Based MPR (SBMPR) mechanism, overcoming format incompatibilities between the two implementations.</li>
<li>Duff queries Olsrd2 for symmetric neighbors and MPR selectors, converts the data, and feeds it to NRL SMF, also logging the information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> The working group decided to <strong>keep the credit-based flow control documents separate</strong> as they were originally structured, rather than merging them.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Chair):</strong> The chair will send a message to the manet mailing list to confirm the decision to keep the credit-based flow control documents separate and allow a final period for feedback (approximately 1-2 weeks).</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Chair):</strong> The chair will follow up with David Black (TSV reviewer) to confirm that his other comments on the credit-based flow control documents (excluding the merge suggestion) have been satisfactorily addressed in the latest versions.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Chair):</strong> The chair will issue working group adoption calls for the <strong>remaining two D-LAB related drafts</strong> by Henning Roger, in addition to the &quot;radio band parameters&quot; draft already under call, to encourage broader discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Lou Berger):</strong> Lou Berger will revisit the &quot;D-LAB clarifications and lessons learned&quot; draft once the credit-based flow control documents are submitted to the IESG.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Chair):</strong> The chair will follow up with Henning Roger regarding the OLSRv2 router restart recommendations prompted by an interoperability issue.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Chair/Alvaro Retana):</strong> The AD will carry discussions regarding the housing and future of inter-satellite link routing work within the IETF to other routing ADs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Working group members are encouraged to actively participate in the adoption calls for all three D-LAB drafts on the mailing list.</li>
<li>The chair will continue to monitor discussions on inter-satellite link routing and semantic routing across relevant IETF/IRTF groups (DMM, INT, RTGWG, T2RG) to assess potential future engagement for manet.</li>
<li>The chair will work to close an open errata related to a previous document.</li>
<li>A future manet meeting in Philadelphia is anticipated, pending IETF event planning.</li>
