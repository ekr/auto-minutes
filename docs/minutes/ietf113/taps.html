<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 23 Mar 2022 12:00</p>
<h1>taps</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The taps working group session provided updates on existing documents, discussed the upcoming Working Group Last Call (WGLC) for the Implementation draft, and presented a new QUIC mapping document. There was strong support for adopting the QUIC mapping, and a proposal to add a new charter milestone for general protocol mapping documents was introduced. Additionally, a presentation on the PanAPI system, a TAPS-like transport system developed for SCION, offered valuable feedback on the TAPS API design, particularly concerning property handling and the visibility of implementation flexibility.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chairs' Update and Document Status:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Since IETF 111, the working group has held six interim meetings, focusing on resolving review comments.</li>
<li>The Architecture and API documents have concluded WGLC and received ART and internal deep reviews. The API document has only two open issues remaining.</li>
<li>The Implementation draft is nearing WGLC, with a handful of open issues still to be resolved.</li>
<li>An issue with author lists exceeding the recommended five for RFCs was resolved by some contributors electing to remove their names; justification has been prepared for the IESG for documents still above the limit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Document Release Strategy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A suggestion was made to release the Architecture and Interface documents for IESG/IETF last call sooner, rather than waiting for the Implementation draft, to distribute the review workload and allow earlier feedback. The chairs acknowledged this for consideration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reviewers for Implementation Draft WGLC:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A call for non-author reviewers for the Implementation draft's WGLC was made, emphasizing the need for fresh eyes to check for readability, consistency, and comprehension, rather than deep expertise.</li>
<li>Ideally, reviews should be completed within four weeks after IETF 113, around the time of the next interim. No volunteers stepped forward during the session.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Working Group Schedule:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The working group plans monthly interims.</li>
<li>It was reaffirmed that the group will meet every other IETF, meaning no meeting at IETF 114, with the next IETF session planned for IETF 115.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Proposal for Protocol Mapping Milestone:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A new milestone for the charter was proposed: &quot;producing one or more protocol mapping documents.&quot; These documents would illustrate how higher-layer protocols or transport protocols would utilize the TAPS API. This would require Area Director approval.</li>
<li>HTTP was suggested as another protocol that could benefit from a mapping document due to its unclear mapping to TAPS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>QUIC Mapping Document Presentation (Tommy Pauly):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tommy Pauly presented a new draft (<code>draft-pauly-taps-quic-mapping-00</code>), providing an example of how TAPS can be used with QUIC.</li>
<li>The document defines what happens when TAPS API calls are used with QUIC, focusing on establishment, tear-down, and data transfer.</li>
<li><strong>Key Mapping:</strong> A TAPS <code>Connection</code> maps to a QUIC <code>Stream</code>, and a TAPS <code>Connection Group</code> maps to a QUIC <code>Connection</code>.</li>
<li>It details how TAPS functions like <code>Initiate</code>, <code>Cloning</code>, <code>Sending</code>, <code>Receiving</code>, <code>Closing</code>, and <code>Aborting</code> map to QUIC stream and connection operations, including 0-RTT support for <code>Initiate</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Suggestions to add a high-level summary of the mapping's use cases (&quot;what is this good for / not good for&quot;) and to include QUIC datagram mapping within the document for completeness.</li>
<li>Discussion on how TAPS handles QUIC's <code>STOP_SENDING</code> frames; it's not a general TAPS API feature but could be exposed as protocol-specific metadata.</li>
<li>Confirmation that the mapping is sufficient for implementing an HTTP/3 client/server, possibly with protocol-specific metadata for stream IDs.</li>
<li>Clarification that TAPS <code>Connection Groups</code> can encompass both reliable (streams) and unreliable (datagrams) flows on the same underlying QUIC connection.</li>
<li>A need for &quot;background information and surveys&quot; within mapping documents, not just direct mappings, to address nuances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>PanAPI System Presentation (Thorben Krüger):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Thorben Krüger presented PanAPI, a TAPS-like transport system developed for SCION (a future internet architecture focusing on path awareness).</li>
<li>PanAPI uses the TAPS API as its front-end and is implemented in Go, with a web-based scripting backend. It supports TCP, UDP, QUIC, and UDP/QUIC over SCION.</li>
<li><strong>Design Choices/Departures from TAPS:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Explicit SCION support added.</li>
<li><strong>No Event System:</strong> PanAPI leverages Go's native concurrency model (blocking calls, background dispatching for asynchronicity), finding an event-based system unintuitive for Go developers.</li>
<li><strong>Strongly Typed Objects for Properties:</strong> A design choice to catch errors at compile time, which proved challenging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most TAPS concepts map well to SCION, but &quot;active probing&quot; (pinging alternative paths for latency) is a SCION-specific feature without a direct TAPS equivalent.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback for TAPS API:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Property Stages:</strong> The TAPS drafts do not explicitly distinguish between mutable &quot;preference&quot; properties (settings) and converged &quot;truth value&quot; properties (results of selection). This dynamic behavior is difficult for statically-typed languages and could benefit from clearer conceptual distinction in the specification.</li>
<li><strong>Event System Visibility:</strong> The current documentation on the flexibility to implement TAPS without an explicit event system (mentioned in an appendix) should be more prominently placed in the main document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> The working group expressed strong support for adopting the QUIC Mapping document (<code>draft-pauly-taps-quic-mapping-00</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Aaron Falk (chair) will solicit non-author reviewers for the Implementation draft WGLC via the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> The chairs will seek Area Director approval for the proposed new charter milestone for protocol mapping documents.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Tommy Pauly to consider incorporating QUIC datagram mapping and a high-level summary of the mapping's specific use cases into the QUIC mapping document.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Brian Trammell to address GitHub issue #1009, clarifying that TAPS implementations are not strictly required to be event-based, aiming for a PR by the end of the IETF break.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Rhys Engert (chair) to ensure the QUIC mapping document is properly associated as a related document in the DataTracker.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Implementation draft WGLC is planned to open after IETF 113, following resolution of current issues and securing reviewers.</li>
<li>Further discussion on potential protocol mapping documents (e.g., HTTP) is encouraged.</li>
<li>The next working group interim meeting is tentatively scheduled for early May.</li>
