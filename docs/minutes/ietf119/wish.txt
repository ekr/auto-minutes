## Summary
This meeting focused on the status of the WIP and Web drafts. The WIP draft is currently in IETF last call and expected to proceed smoothly. The discussion regarding the Web draft was hampered by the absence of the presenter, Sergio, and his slides. The group reviewed open issues and pull requests in the Web draft's repository, discussing potential solutions and next steps for each.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **WIP Draft Status:** The WIP draft is in IETF last call and is expected to progress quickly due to minimal comments received.
*   **Web Draft - Lack of Presentation:** Sergio's absence and lack of slides limited the planned discussion on the Web draft.
*   **Web Draft - Pull Request:** Reviewed a pull request addressing the scenario where a requested resource does not exist, proposing a 404 error response.
*   **Web Draft - Issue: Screen End Notification:** Discussed whether the web player should be notified when the media server terminates the connection. The general consensus was "yes."
*   **Web Draft - Issue: Codec Negotiation:** Explored how to handle codec negotiation failures, referencing past feedback where client-side offers were preferred to allow subscribers to open a stream before it becomes available. The lack of support for updated offer/answer exchanges was noted as a constraint.
* **Web Draft - Issue: Mute and Unmute Expressions:** This issue was not discussed due to time constraints.
* **Area Change**: The Working Group has transferred to the WIT area, to be overseen by Francesca.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Pull Request (Attribute Requirements):** Victor to comment on the pull request.
*   **Codec Negotiation:** More input is needed from the wider community regarding the best approach for handling codec negotiation failures, especially considering the absence of updated offer/answer.
*   **Francesca:** To schedule an interim meeting to continue work on the Web draft once the area transfer is complete.

## Next Steps

*   Sergio to address the identified pull request and issues in the Web draft repository.
*   Solicit community feedback on codec negotiation issue.
*   Francesca to schedule an interim meeting to further discuss the Web draft.
*   The Working Group will wind down after completion of the Web draft, with potential future extensions being discussed elsewhere.
