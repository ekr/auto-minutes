<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 21 Mar 2024 05:30</p>
<h1>witarea</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This was the first meeting of the new Web and Internet Transport (WIT) area. The session included an overview of the area's formation, its constituent working groups, and updates on the progress of various documents.  There were presentations from the area directors on the working groups that moved into the new area.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Area Formation:</strong> The WIT area was formed by splitting working groups from the ART and Transport areas based on their relevance to web and internet transport technologies. Security related working groups went to the Security area, and Art working groups went to Art.</li>
<li><strong>Working Group Updates:</strong> Chairs provided updates on their working group activities. These updates were linked from the working group names in a presentation slide.</li>
<li><strong>RFC Status:</strong> There are 5 new drafts in the RFC editor's queue and 4 RFCs published since IETF 118. An ABTX document that was lingering since 2017 finally reached the RFC editor.</li>
<li><strong>AD and Chair Changes:</strong> AVTcore and MOCK both have AD changes, with the new AD moving to the head.  MOCK also has a chair change: Martin Duke is taking over from Ted Hardy who is stepping down.</li>
<li><strong>Congestion Control Working Group (CCWG):</strong> Nearing completion of updates to RFC 5333.  Discussion is starting regarding rechartering to standardize congestion control algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Multipath TCP (MPTCP) and Lower Latency Scalable Services (L4S):</strong> Updates on MPTCP and L4S.</li>
<li><strong>Quick:</strong> New work in Quick is focused on standardized logging formats (Q log) and Multipath.</li>
<li><strong>TAPS:</strong> The TAPS working group is closing soon.</li>
<li><strong>TSB Art Review Team and HTTP Directorate:</strong> These review teams will be maintained under WIT as they were in their previous areas. Encourage early HTTP API reviews.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>CCWG Rechartering:</strong> CCWG will start a discussion about rechartering to standardize pedestrian congestion controls.</li>
<li><strong>MOCK AD Change:</strong>  The change of ADs for MOCK will be submitted to the head.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Attendees should review the presentation slides and recordings for more detailed information on each working group.</li>
<li>Review the documents, subscribe to the mailing lists and plan to attend the meetings that are of interest.</li>
</ul>
