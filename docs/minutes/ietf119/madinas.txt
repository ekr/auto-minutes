## Summary

This IETF Madinas session focused on the working group's progress on MAC address randomization and related privacy concerns. Key discussions revolved around the readiness for publication of the MAC address randomization current state document, the use cases and identity requirements document potentially going to working group last call, and a liaison statement from the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA) regarding open roaming and privacy.
