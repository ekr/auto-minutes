## Summary

The DTN working group meeting covered a wide range of topics, including updates on existing documents, discussion of new work proposals, and coordination with other standards organizations like 3GPP. Key discussion points revolved around coapp over BP, bundle encapsulation, quality of service extensions, endpoint ID patterns, and network management architecture. The group addressed IPR disclosures, agenda updates, and welcomed new Area Directors.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **CoAP over BP:** Discussion on carrying CoAP over BP, including message format, scope parameters, the observe option, blockwise transfers, and URI schemes. Feedback was provided on message ID size, potential optimizations, and congestion control.
*   **Bundle and Bundle Encapsulation Updates:** Updates on the Bibe convergence layer, service provider DTN networks, and implementation changes in ION. Discussions centered on the role of admin records and potential impacts on RFC 9171.
*   **Quality of Service Extension for Bundle Protocol:** Presentation on a proposed extension block for QoS, focusing on traffic prioritization, reliability, and latest-only flags. Debates included the motivation for a network extension block and the placement of the inserting node ID.
*   **Bundle Protocol Endpoint ID Patterns:** Discussions on the need for identifying sets of endpoint identifiers, including the syntax and semantics for EID patterns. Considerations revolved around regular expressions, security identities, and potential interactions with routing.
*   **3GPP Use Cases:** A summary of use cases related to store and forward coming out of 3GPP, particularly in the context of satellite communications. Coordination with 3GPP and awareness of relevant standards were highlighted.
*	**Network Management Architecture:** Update on the progress of DTNMA, including adoption of the data model and URI encodings. Open issues and future directions were discussed.
*   **DTN URI:** There was discussion about DTN URI design and the need for standards. There was discussion of how it could interact with the DNS system.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IPN URI Scheme:** Awaiting AD go-ahead.
*   **DTNMA:** Incorporate comments and continue discussions with other working groups.
*   **Cozy Contacts and BPb7 Admin Record Types:** Proceed to ISG review phase.
*   **DTN Management Model and Resource Identifier:** Continue progressing the specifications.
*   **Shepherds:** Seek shepherds for the "BPsec Cozy Contexts" and "VP version 7 administrative record updates registry" documents.
*   **CoAP over BP:** Authors to revisit the necessity of a new URI scheme (coap+bp) and explore alternative solutions like reusing the coap scheme with unambiguous endpoint ID handling.
*   **Bundle and Bundle Encapsulation:** Review comments on the use of admin records and explore alternative approaches to avoid changing RFC 9171, particularly a flag to indicate Vibe in the payload.
*   **Quality of Service Extension:** Consider using a bib to identify network and network extension blocks.
*   **3GPP Liaison:** Coordinate with Charles Eckl to establish a liaison with 3GPP SA2 and identify relevant contact points for ensuring awareness of DTN standards.
*   **DTN URI Design:** Explore existing implementations. Consider a more formal specification.

## Next Steps

*   Revise milestones to reflect current progress and timelines.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for technical topics, including CoAP over BP optimizations, bundle encapsulation details, QoS extension designs, and EID pattern syntax.
*   Develop implementation of proposed changes and test interoperability.
*   Update and resubmit expired drafts to the data tracker.
