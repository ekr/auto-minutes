# 6lo

## Summary

This meeting covered the current status of several working group documents, including updates and plans for publication. Key topics included path-aware semantic addressing for LLNs (PASA), the generic address assignment option for 6LoWPAN (GAO), reliability considerations for PASA, transmission of SHell compressed packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks, and transmission of IPv6 packets over short-range optical wireless communication (OWC). There was also a change of the responsible AD role to Eric Vyncke.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **AD Transition:** Eric Vyncke takes over as responsible AD for 6lo, replacing Eric Klein.
*   **Encryption Draft:** Currently with the ISG and undergoing reviews from the transport area. An updated version is expected soon. The IPR status regarding updating RFC 4861 is being clarified.
*   **PASA Draft:** Updated to rely on the GAO option. The document is considered stable and ready for 6lo and other area reviews.
*   **GAO Draft:** A bit has been defined to make address confirmation optional. A new "AAF not supported" error condition has been defined, with discussion needed on recommended actions.  The allocated bit for 6CIO needs to be fixed due to a conflict.  More discussion on the mailing list is desired before adoption.
*   **PASA Reliability Draft:** Authors are open to merging with the PASA document, publishing as an informational RFC, or letting it expire. Suggestion to add a concise summary to documents that are advancing to the Telechat.
*   **SHell Compression Draft:** Several updates related to rule ID reuse in different modes and updates to the raw frame format.  The context is out of scope for 15.4 nodes. The position of the hop limit field in relation to the destination address was discussed.
*   **Optical Wireless Draft:** Updates based on previous comments, including clarification on bidirectional communication and the necessity of path MTU. The inclusion of SCHC is also discussed.
*   **Access to IEEE Specs:** The chairs noted the IEEE 802.15.7 is free after 6 months and there are ongoing efforts to ensure sufficient access to core specifications for review.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **PASA Draft:** Solicit reviews from 6lo and other areas.
*   **GAO Draft:** Hold further discussion on the mailing list regarding "AAF not supported" error handling and the 6CIO bit allocation. Update the draft.
*   **Optical Wireless Draft:** Separate references into normative and informative. The authors will prepare the draft for adoption.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list.
*   Address outstanding issues in the drafts.
*   Aim for updated drafts before the Vancouver meeting.
*   Proceed with a mailing list vote on the adoption of the Optical Wireless Draft.
