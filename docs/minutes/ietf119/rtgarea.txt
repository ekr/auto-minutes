## Summary

The Routing Area open meeting covered updates from the RIFT, LISP, and SPRING working groups. Key topics included the near completion of the RIFT base specification, the rechartering of the LISP working group, and ongoing work within the SPRING working group, particularly on MNA (Network Actions). The meeting also highlighted the Routing Area office hours.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RIFT:**
    *   The RIFT base protocol specification (draft-ietf-rift-20) has passed IETF last call and is undergoing revisions.
    *   The applicability statement is undergoing one revision to align with the latest specification changes.
    *   The YANG model is under AD evaluation, with a potential need for one more revision.
    *   Future work items for RIFT include K-value store policy, segment routing, multi-topology support, dragonfly topologies, zero-touch provisioning for other protocols (e.g., EVPN), and exploration of the use of RIFT in newer AI/ML data center architectures.
*   **LISP:**
    *   The LISP working group has a new charter, approved on January 26th.
    *   Several experimental documents are being moved to the standards track.
    *   Ongoing work includes multicast, reliable transport for the mapping system, YANG models, traffic engineering, security and privacy (advertising EIDs), external connectivity, and mobility.
    *   Traffic engineering document needs review. The name and coding document is near completion and being discussed for standard vs. experimental track status. Several drafts are also nearing completion, including Reliable Transport and YANG model.
*   **SPRING:**
    *   Adrian stepped down as co-chair, and Tony Lee is the incoming co-chair.
    *   Significant work is focused on MNA (Network Actions).
    *   Implementation experience reports for MNA are being reviewed.
    *   An interim meeting after IETF 119 is planned to address MNA issues.
    *   A liaison statement from ITU-T SG11 regarding trace route for MPLS was received and responded to.
*   **Routing Area:**
    *   Routing area office hours are held on Thursdays at lunchtime.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **RIFT:**
    *   Encourage review of the RIFT base specification (draft-ietf-rift-20).
    *   Continue discussions regarding the rechartering of the RIFT working group.
*   **LISP:**
    *   Resubmit the name and coding document and consider for standard track.
    *   Continue work on Reliable Transport and YANG model drafts.
*   **SPRING:**
    *   Plan an interim meeting after IETF 119 focusing on MNA.

## Next Steps

*   RIFT, LISP and SPRING working groups to continue to work on their respective charters.
*   Area directors will continue to be available during office hours for questions and guidance.
