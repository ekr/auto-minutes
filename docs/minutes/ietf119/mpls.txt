## Summary

This meeting covered the working group status, updates on the "First Nibble" draft, discussion of use cases for MPLS network actions (M&A), and a presentation on extending ICMPv6 for SRv6 validation.  Key discussions revolved around the deprecation of certain behaviors related to the "First Nibble" and the need for control plane validation in SRv6 networks.  The meeting also included acknowledgements to outgoing and incoming chairs and area directors.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Working Group Status:**
    *   Review of reports, a liaison statement, and documents expiring.
    *   The SFL control document is currently subject to a formal poll on the mailing list due to issues raised during IETF Last Call.
*   **"First Nibble" Update:**
    *   Terminology change: "MPLS First Nibble" is now referred to as "Post-Stack First Nibble".
    *   Updates to RFC 4928 were extracted into a separate section.
    *   Discussion on whether to use normative language ("should" or "must") regarding deprecating behaviors and identifying flows.
    *   IANA registry considerations and options for the "Post-Stack First Nibble" value registrations.
    *   Security considerations: potential addition of text regarding fixing a security hole by deprecating certain behaviors.
*   **M&A Use Cases Update:**
    *   The document focuses on three network actions: fast reroute, C2OEM, and network slicing/resource partitioning.
    *   Other use cases are included for informational purposes in an appendix.
    *   The document is considered stable and ready for working group last call.
*   **SRv6 Validation:**
    *   Presentation on extending ICMPv6 for SRv6 related information validation.
    *   Discussion on the need for validation between data and control planes in SRv6, drawing comparisons with MPLS FEC validation.
    *   Suggestions to also present the SRv6 validation draft in the `best` working group since it involves service based services like EVPN.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **"First Nibble" Draft:**
    *   Authors will consider the feedback on normative language ("should" vs. "must") regarding deprecation of behaviors.
    *   Authors will update the document with potential security considerations.
    *   Authors will come back to the group with a proposed update on the IANA registry after further discussions with IANA.
*   **M&A Use Cases:**
    *   Working group chairs to verify consensus on the document's stability.
    *   If consensus is confirmed, the document will proceed to working group last call.
*   **SRv6 Validation:**
    *   The authors to consider presenting this draft at the `best` working group.
    *   Seek requirements and feedback from network operators on the SRv6 draft.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on the MPLS mailing list regarding the SFL control document and "First Nibble" draft.
*   Address action items listed above.
*   The next MPLS session will be in Vancouver in about 3 to 4 months.
