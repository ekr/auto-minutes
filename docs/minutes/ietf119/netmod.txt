# netmod

## Summary

The netmod working group meeting covered a range of topics, including updates on existing drafts, discussions around versioning and file naming conventions for YANG modules, and presentations on new proposals such as validating data with YANG libraries, YANG-based sensors, YANG full embed, data provenance, network management architecture in challenged environments, a common YANG data model for scheduling, and power management using YANG models. The meeting resulted in decisions to revisit certain aspects of drafts and to continue discussions on the mailing list.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **ACL Extensions:** The working group was urged to review and comment on the second last call for ACL extensions.
*   **Draft Status Updates:** A new procedure was introduced, requiring status updates for all working group documents at every IETF meeting, aligned with the Internet cut-off date.
*   **Syslog Draft:** The syslog draft had expired due to dependencies, but a new version (-32) has been created.
*   **Microwave Topology and Sub-interface drafts:** Editorial updates have been made, and the drafts are ready for review and advancement.
*   **Yang Module Versioning Update:** Several changes were made based on feedback, including removing revision label schemes and simplifying minimum import statements. The impact of branched histories on revision dates was discussed.
*   **Semantic Versioning Update:** This draft focuses on semantic versioning for YANG modules, introducing a new extension, recommended min version. Also incorporating IETF Yang Library augmentations.
*   **Filename conventions:** The discussion resulted in a consensus to revisit this, and aim for some consensus to come from this.
*   **Validating any data with a YANG Library:** Presentation on the challenges and proposed solutions for validating `anydata` elements in YANG. A key question raised was how to handle complete versus incomplete data trees.
*   **Yang-Based Sensors to Metry Tree** General framework for collecting telemetry data.
*   **Yang Full Embed** The use of a new extension to reuse device level model in a network level model.
*   **Data Provenance** The discussion was about guaranteeing the integrity of Yang Datasets, including what has happened with data.
*   **Network management architecture in challenged environments** Applying best practices, a rule based system using a generalized autonomy model.
*   **Common YANG data model for scheduling:** Discussion of the existing and ongoing work related to the scheduling context and various scheduling applications.
*   **Power Management:** Presentation on the YANG model for power management.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **ACL Extensions:** The working group to take action on reviewing and commenting on the second last call for ACL extensions.
*   **Filename Conventions:** The topic of filename conventions, will be revisited in an attempt to achieve some consensus on the matter. Focused consensus call should be on the list.
*   **Module State:** Consider augmenting module state to accommodate for backwards compatibility.
*   **YANG Doctors:** Forward the network management architecture in challenged environments draft for review on the YANG Doctors list.
*   **File names and Yang Semver:** Work to make a two line change to the toolchain to support the use of the file names with different version labels.

## Next Steps

*   Request working group last call for updated versioning module and the December drafts after file name concerns have been addressed.
*   The presenter of the scheduled module will evaluate whether to stay in the ops area working group or transition to netmod.
*   The power management module will be presented in the green boff for continued development.
*   Diego will come back and report results when the proof of concept for data provenance is complete.
