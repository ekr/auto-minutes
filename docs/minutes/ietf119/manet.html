## Summary

The MANET working group met to discuss AODVv2 and charter revision. Charlie Perkins presented on the status of AODVv2, highlighting its evolution and key differences from AODV. The group also discussed the existing charter, potential new work items, and the path toward a recharter. AD Jim Guichard provided guidance on adopting new work items.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **AODVv2 Status:** Charlie Perkins presented the current status of AODVv2, its history, and differences from the original AODV. Concerns about implementability were raised and discussed. Potential for isometric routing was mentioned.
*   **AODVv2 Adoption:** Questions about the prior removal of AODVv2 from the charter were raised. The possibility of incorporating AI/ML optimization techniques in the future was briefly mentioned.
*   **Charter Revision Status:** Ronald presented the status of existing charter items. The group discussed potential new work items, including:
    *   DELAP maintenance and extensions.
    *   Babel maintenance and extensions.
    *   Energy-efficient routing.
    *   New approaches to multicast (bitstring-based).
    *   Reactive routing protocols.
    *   An update to RFC 2501 (Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) Routing Protocol Requirements)
*   **Adoption of Individual Drafts:** The AD, Jim Guichard, clarified that the working group could proceed with adopting individual drafts related to DLAP extensions, as it is considered within the scope of the existing charter, despite the previous guidance of not taking on any new work until existing drafts were completed.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Chairs to review comments from the mailing list and previous discussions regarding the AODVv2 draft.
*   **Action Item:** Charlie Perkins to address IANA's questions regarding registries for metric type and address type in AODVv2.
*   **Action Item:** Working group members to provide feedback on potential new charter items via the mailing list.
*   **Decision:** Adopt the three individual DLAP extension drafts as working group documents.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion of AODVv2 and charter revision on the mailing list.
*   Evaluate the issues surrounding AODVv2 and its potential adoption by the working group.
*   Assess community interest and participation in potential new work items for a recharter.
