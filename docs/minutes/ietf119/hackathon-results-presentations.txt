# Hackathon Results Presentations

## Summary
The session consisted of presentations of various projects completed during the IETF Hackathon. The projects spanned a wide range of topics including augmented YANG modules, deterministic encoding for seaborne serialization, multicast source routing, HTTP signature authentication, network attestation for secure routing, post-quantum cryptography in X.509 certificates, DDoS mitigation architecture, SDN-based open playgrounds, network anomaly detection, extensions to the YANG data model for DOTS, YANG push publisher validation, low latency crypto, RPKI/RTR improvements, fake conversation generation, DNS enhancements, and intent-based network management for mobile objects.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Augmented YANG Modules:** Presented an implementation to provide an easy solution for getting dependencies of YANG modules, particularly for Kafka data mesh architectures. Testing showed improved execution times.
*   **Seaborne Serialization:** Discussed deterministic encoding (CDE) and DC Board drafts and their implementation in QC War. Aim is to accommodate constrained use cases and unify number serialization.
*   **MSR6 Evaluation:** Hardware evaluation of MSR6TE and MSR6TE with RLP using P4 language. Results indicated low resource usage and acceptable delay increase.
*   **HTTP Signature Authentication:** First interoperability test of a draft providing authenticated HTTP resources without telegraphing. Success noted, with some practicalities remaining for existing protocol stacks.
*   **Network Attestation for Secure Routing (NASR):** Proposed a new initiative for path-level trust based on remote attestation of network devices. Aim is to guarantee forwarding behavior of devices.
*   **Post Quantum X.509:** Continued progress on post-quantum cryptography with focus on incorporating NIST primitives, testing composite implementations, and maintaining OID mapping tables.
*   **SAVI DDoS Mitigation:** Presented a DDoS mitigation architecture focused on identifying forged source addresses and distributing security intelligence.
*   **SDN Open Playground:** Implementation of objects for deploying inter-domain networks, focusing on information sharing.
*   **Anomaly Tagging on Historical Data (Antagonist):** Described a project for structured exchange of network anomaly data and information, and discussed how this can improve AI-based network anomaly detection.
*   **Extended YANG Data Model for DOTS:** Proposed extensions to the DOTS protocol to meet current collaborative mitigation needs, reporting a potential improvement in mitigation time from minutes to seconds.
*   **Validate YANG Push Publisher:** Reported on validating YANG Push publisher against data collection with multiple vendor implementations, focusing on integration into Apache Kafka.
*   **Ultra-Low Latency Crypto:** Described work on a new lightweight and secure encryption algorithm that is suitable for e-sports and remote surgery. Seeking volunteers to implement this.
*   **RPKI RTR and AS Path Validation:** Presented both Perl and Rust-based implementations of RPKI-RTR functionality.
*   **Fake Conversation Generator:** Presented a VCON related project to generate fake conversation data for testing PII redaction.
*   **DNS Kabar:** Reported on work relating to compact denial of existence and delegated zone-signed child synchronization.
*   **Intent Based Network Management:** Described an architecture for mobile network management, focusing on configuring network and security applications for SDVs and other mobile objects.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   The fake beacon generator will be put into the IETF GitHub
*   Register on the Wiki to present results at the Hack Demo Happy Hour.

## Next Steps

*   Continue work on post-quantum cryptography, meeting monthly.
*   Validate the Antagonist project with network operational data.
*   Continue work on DNS Kabar implementation after the hackathon.
*   Future meetings to be scheduled for network attestation initiative.
