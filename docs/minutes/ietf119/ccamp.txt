## Summary

The CCAMP session at IETF 119 covered working group document status, active calls, and individual drafts. Discussions focused on optical impairment topology, WDM tunnel and path computation models, Transport NBI, pluggable coherent optics, and fine-grained OTN. A key theme was aligning models, addressing gaps, and ensuring scalability for new technologies.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Optical Impairment Topology:** The young model is stable and progressing towards working group last call, aiming for simultaneous progression with RFC 9093 bis.
*   **WDM Tunnel Model:** Updates include transceiver parameter constraints and synchronization with RFC 9093 bis. Open issues involve 3R region modeling and supporting both integrated and remote transponders.
*   **Optical Path Computation Model:** The model is being renamed to WDM Path Computation to align with the WDM tunnel draft and updated to align with 9093 bis.
*   **Transport NBI:** This effort aims to provide guidance on using existing young models for northbound interfaces in optical domain controllers. Definition of "Transport NBI" is under discussion on GitHub, with collaboration on terminology. Discussions are ongoing on inventory management and topology modeling.
*   **Pluggable Coherent Optics:** Focus is on two documents: one detailing scenarios, use cases, and gap analysis, and the other modeling coherent pluggables. A key consideration is ensuring the models support both traditional transponders and pluggable scenarios.
*   **Service PM Draft:** This addresses service-level performance monitoring, including automated service acceptance testing and private line SLA assurance. Formal working group adoption is still pending.
*   **Agent Interface:** An interface is created to support the FCAPS interface. It aims to inherit the functions of traditional interfaces.
*   **Fine-Grained OTN:** Extension requirements for PCE and control protocols were presented. Centralized computation model is considered suitable to meet the new requirement.
*   **Microwave Radio Link:** Work is ongoing to create a biz of the microwave radio link, focusing on gap analysis and aligning with Etsy and open config standards.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Chairs to double-check the charter to ensure that it gives permission to publish the results of work from the Transport NBI Design Team as an informational RFC.
*   **Action Item:** Transport NBI Design Team to send out the initial text that describes the group and scope for review on the mailing list.
*   **Decision:** CCAMP working group will consider the adoption of the Service PM draft.
*   **Action Item:** Microwave Radio Link group to share meeting minutes on the mailing list and work towards working group adoption of the draft.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs to set up a Webex or similar for the Microwave Radio Link calls.

## Next Steps

*   Optical Impairment Topology and RFC 9093 bis to progress towards working group last call concurrently.
*   WDM Tunnel and Path Computation Models to address open issues and seek feedback from operators and implementers.
*   Transport NBI Design Team to continue refining use cases and aligning terminology.
*   Pluggable Coherent Optics work to focus on finalizing the two core documents.
*   Service PM draft adoption to be considered.
*   Follow up on Agent interface work from the main list.
*   Fine-Grained OTN group to engage in further gap analysis and protocol design.
*   Microwave Radio Link group to finish the gap analysis for the existing microwave work with other standards bodies, such as Etsy and Open Config, and submit it to the mailing list.
