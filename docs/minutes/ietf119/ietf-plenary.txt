# IETF Plenary

## Summary

The IETF 119 Plenary session included reports from the IETF Chair, IAB, IRTF, NomCom, IETF Trust, and LLC. Discussions covered meeting statistics, upcoming events, financial status, and technical initiatives such as the IPv6-mostly network experiment. The session also included in memoriam for Dave Mills and Fabio Maino. The session concluded with open microphone Q&A for the LLC, ISG and IAB.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IPv6-Mostly Network Experiment:** The IETFNOC proposed an experiment to transition to an IPv6-mostly network, where clients without IPv4 addresses signal their capability to the network. Legacy clients would continue to receive IPv4 addresses.
*   **IETF Community Survey:** The 2023 community survey results indicated that the IETF is successful in its mission and principles but needs improvement in gender diversity. Email remains the universally preferred communication method.
*   **LLC Financial Status:** The LLC presented a financial overview, highlighting the importance of diverse revenue streams and the role of the Internet Society (ISOC) support. Challenges related to the public support test for non-profits were discussed. The shift to more targeted, sector-specific fundraising was announced.
*   **ISG Transitions and Initiatives:** The ISG announced new and outgoing members. Plans to re-run the All-Dispatch experiment at the next IETF meeting based on community feedback were outlined.
*   **IAB Report:** The IAB reported on published RFCs, statements and a new website, thanked outgoing members and introduced the new IAB Chair, Tommy Polly.
*   **RFC discoverability:** Attendees discussed the difficulty of finding relevant and current RFCs for specific topics.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IETFNOC IPv6 Experiment:** The IETFNOC will proceed with planning the IPv6-mostly network experiment. The community is asked to provide feedback. (Action Item: Lauren to send out an email address where feedback can be sent)
*   **ISG All-Dispatch Experiment:** The ISG will rerun the all-dispatch experiment at the next IETF meeting, incorporating community feedback.
*   **LLC Targeted Fundraising:** The LLC will develop a sector-specific approach to fundraising, beginning with the domain name industry.
*  **ISG Office Hours:** Explore making MeetEcho available for AD office hours to enable remote participation.

## Next Steps

*   IETFNOC to collect community feedback on the IPv6-mostly network proposal.
*   ISG to analyze feedback on the All-Dispatch experiment and adjust for the next iteration.
*   LLC to develop and implement the sector-specific fundraising strategy.
*   The LLC will remodel the RFC editor website.
