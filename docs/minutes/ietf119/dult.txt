## Summary
The DULT (Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers) working group held its first meeting to discuss unwanted tracking scenarios and develop solutions to mitigate the harms associated with the misuse of Bluetooth tracking devices. The meeting covered administrative aspects, introductions, presentations on unwanted tracking scenarios, the state of the current Internet Draft, and suggestions for initiating the working group's Internet Draft process. Key discussions revolved around threat modeling, standardization, the scope of the charter, and engaging with non-technical communities.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Unwanted Tracking Scenarios:** Presentations highlighted real-world scenarios of misuse of Bluetooth trackers, focusing on domestic violence, co-parenting situations, and the technical challenges faced by survivors.
*   **Limitations of Existing Protections:** The limitations of current tracking prevention mechanisms on different operating systems (iOS, Android) were discussed, including lack of active scanning capabilities and customization options.
*   **Charter Scope:** Discussions addressed the scope of the working group's charter, clarifying that it is limited to Bluetooth location trackers but allows for defining payloads that work on other transports besides Bluetooth, and that it does include near field communications.
*   **Threat Modeling:** Emphasis was placed on the need for a clear threat model to guide the design and development of the protocol.
*   **Standardization:** The importance of standardization for both passive and active scanning across major operating systems was emphasized.
*   **Onboarding Process:** Discussions included the need for a standardized onboarding process for manufacturers to register their products and enable them to be detectable by platforms.
*   **Engagement with Non-Technical Communities:** Strategies for engaging non-technical communities, such as advocacy groups, and making technical information more accessible were explored.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Document Creation:** The working group will create four primary documents:
    *   Crowdsourced Finding Network Architecture.
    *   Unwanted Tracking Reference Based on the Algorithm.
    *   Protocol between Accessories and Nearby Devices (including data formats).
    *   Overall Adult Threat Model.
*   **Adopt Existing Draft:** The working group will adopt the existing Internet Draft as a starting point (skeleton) for document number 3 (Protocol between Accessories and Nearby Devices).
*   **Authorship:** Apple and Google will co-author document 3. Other authors are welcome.
*   **Volunteers:** Christine volunteered to help with document 1 (Crowdsourced Finding Network Architecture) and Rowan is happy to help.
*   **GitHub Repository:** The working group will leverage the GitHub repository to store Internet Drafts and other resources, including translations from "nerd speak" to plain language, pictures, and training materials.
*   **Community Engagement:** The group will aim to create documentation accessible for non-technical communities and to promote community translation.

## Next Steps
*   Circulate documents to begin work.
*   Circle with people who have volunteered.
*   Initiate development of the four primary documents, starting with document 3 and document 1.
*   Develop scenarios to better populate threat model.
*   Establish collaboration between the author teams of the documents.
*   Consider how to translate back to the outside from the documents, and consider plain language descriptions.
