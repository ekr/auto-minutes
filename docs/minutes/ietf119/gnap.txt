# gnap Meeting Minutes

## Summary

The gnap working group meeting focused on the status of the gnap core protocol and the Resource Server (RS) draft. The gnap core protocol has been approved by the ISG for publication. The RS draft received no responses during the working group last call, leaving its future uncertain. The editors recommend closing the working group after addressing the RS draft.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **gnap Core Protocol:** Approved by the ISG for publication. Minor changes were made and a new version (-20) was published to reflect those changes.
*   **gnap Resource Server (RS) Draft:**  Received zero feedback during the working group last call. The future of the document is under discussion.
*   **Jose Token Type Changes:** A syntactical change was made to the Jose token types for Jose key bindings (changed `gnap-binding+JWSD` to `gnap-binding-JWSD`).
*   **User Code Length Recommendation:** Added a recommendation for the number of characters in user codes (2-8 characters). This is not a requirement.
*   **RS Draft Implementations:** Limited implementations exist for the entire RS draft end-to-end.  Some components (introspection, JAW formatted tokens) have implementations.
*   **Working Group Closure:** Editors recommend closing the working group after addressing the RS draft.
*   **Vancouver Meeting:**  The editors do not believe a meeting will be required in Vancouver.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Discuss RS Draft with AD:** The chairs and authors will discuss the RS draft with the AD/incoming AD soon after this IETF meeting.
*   **Determine Next Steps for RS Draft:** The working group will determine the best path forward for the RS draft, with the editor's preference being submission to the ISG.
*   **Implementations Using Jose Bindings:** Implementations using Jose key bindings need to update the token type strings to replace the "+" with "-".
*   **Working Group Closure:** Following discussion with the AD, the working group will likely be closed.

## Next Steps

*   Discuss the RS draft with the AD and determine the next steps.
*   Address the RS draft and prepare for potential working group closure.
