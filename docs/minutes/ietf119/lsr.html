<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 21 Mar 2024 03:00</p>
<h1>lsr</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The LSR working group session covered a range of topics, including working group document status, updates on ongoing drafts, and presentations of new proposals. Key discussions revolved around the adoption of drafts related to multi-part TLVs, querying router implementation details, source address verification, signaling aggregate header size limits, advertising multi-interface ID for L2 bundle members, scheduled metric changes for TBR, colored IP prefix, and using FlexAlgo for SR-based ARPs, each with its own set of considerations and concerns.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-part TLVs:</strong> The draft is proposed for working group last call, emphasizing the need for implementations to provide controls to prevent or deal with partial deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Router Implementation Details:</strong> A draft aiming to query router implementation tires of protocols was discussed. The working group agreed to adopt it.</li>
<li><strong>Source Address Verification:</strong> A method for source address verification in intra-domain networks was presented, which led to a discussion on protocol extensions.</li>
<li><strong>Signaling Aggregate Header Size Limits:</strong> A proposal to signal aggregate header size limits via IGP extensions sparked concerns about the IGP acting as a &quot;dump truck&quot; and the complexity of IPv6 extension headers. Suggestion to move discussion to 6man WG.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising Multi-interface ID for L2 Bundle Members:</strong> A draft that would help network operators to control traffic by advertising the local and remote interface IDs for a true boundary member in ITP. The draft will add the other use case beside discovery by the controller.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduled Metric Changes for TBR:</strong> A presentation discussing HP extensions for TBR encountered resistance, with concerns about diverging from the TBR working group's direction (Yang model distribution) and overloading the IGP.</li>
<li><strong>Colored IP Prefix:</strong> Presenting colored IP prefix as an enhancement to IDB's shortcut. The group discussed if tags could also be used for this purpose.</li>
<li><strong>FlexAlgo for SR-based ARPs:</strong> A proposal using FlexAlgo for SR-based ARPs faced scrutiny regarding potential conflicts with existing l2 bundles and the best path metric types.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adopted:</strong> The working group agreed to adopt the draft on querying router implementation details.</li>
<li><strong>Last Call:</strong> The draft on multi-part TLVs is likely to be put forward for working group last call soon.</li>
<li><strong>Hold/Revise:</strong> The draft on FlexAlgo for SR-based ARPs should be put on hold until there's consensus on key issues, and discussions should continue in both LSR and TEAS working groups. The e-bit discussion will be continued on the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Mailing List Discussion:</strong> Further discussion on the distribution of schedule information for TBR and whether it should go into the IGP will be conducted on the TBR mailing list, with LSR CC'd.</li>
<li><strong>Update Draft:</strong> Authors of the 'advertising multi-interface ID' document to add another use case that has been discussed in the group, beside discovery by the controller.</li>
<li><strong>Update Draft:</strong> Authors of the 'IGP flash algo with link loss' to add a description stating that it is a good guideline to have a similar method for the Flex Algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Move forward with working group last call for the multi-part TLV draft.</li>
<li>Initiate adoption call for the draft on router implementation details.</li>
<li>Continue discussions and revisions on drafts related to FlexAlgo for SR-based ARPs, TBR extensions, and other topics based on the feedback received.</li>
<li>Consider operational guidance document on using Link Loss as a Flex Algorithm constraint</li>
</ul>
