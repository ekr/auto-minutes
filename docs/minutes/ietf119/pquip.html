## Summary

The pquip working group meeting covered several topics related to post-quantum cryptography. Presentations included updates on the &quot;PQC for Engineers&quot; draft, the &quot;Terminology&quot; draft, the &quot;Signature Spectrum&quot; draft, and a &quot;Post Quantum Migrations&quot; draft. The meeting concluded with a discussion on hybrid signature schemes and potential standardization efforts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **PQC for Engineers Draft:** Updates since IETF 118 include signature sizes for LMS schemes, clarification on cipher commitment in canVAS Diffie-Hellman, and name changes to ML-KEM/ML-DSA.
*   **Terminology Draft:** Working group last call revealed that the draft needs further work. Key considerations include the timing of publication relative to NIST's draft, the definition of &quot;composite,&quot; and the specific terms to be included.
*   **Signature Spectrum Draft:** The draft is being updated based on feedback and a new version will be available soon.
*   **Post Quantum Migrations Draft:** The document aims to create a taxonomy of use cases and approaches for post-quantum crypto. It is currently focused on digital signatures. The chairs requested feedback on the draft.
*   **Stateful Hash-Based Signature Schemes:** Discussion on operational considerations for stateful hash-based signatures focusing on the challenges of managing state and ensuring reliable deployments and backups.
*   **Hybrid Signature Schemes:** In depth discussion of composite, unlinked multiple signatures, linked multiple signatures and counter signatures, and how they relate to existing RFCs. Security properties of each was explored.
*   **Standardization:** Explored potential benefits and drawbacks of standardization, including the potential for interoperability and the impact on combinatorics. There was a call for protocols to define their required security properties for hybrid schemes.
*   **Security Properties:** The working group agreed that it is essential to understand the security properties that IETF protocols need from hybrid schemes.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Terminology Draft:** Update the draft based on the working group last call comments and other comments on the list and present the draft at the April interim meeting.
*   **Steven:** Prime the mailing list with a named anti-pattern relevant to the terminology draft.
*   **Signature Spectrum Draft:** Authors to release a new draft incorporating feedback and trigger an adoption call.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on the mailing list regarding the &quot;PQC for Engineers&quot; draft.
*   Update and continue discussion of terminology draft.
*   New draft of signature spectrum.
*   The Working Group will have 1 or 2 interims in the coming months before the next IETF meeting. The dates and times will be discussed on the list.
*   The Open PGP working group will discuss hybrid signatures.
*   Protocols should state required security properties.
