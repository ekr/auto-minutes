## Summary
The intarea working group meeting covered several topics, including updates on existing drafts, presentations on provisioning domains for proxy configurations, utility protocol interfaces, ICMP extensions for system identification, and a solution for source address validation in wireless LANs (SAVI WLAN). The meeting included discussions on adoption of drafts, clarifications on protocol specifications, and consideration of future work items.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IANA Considerations and APF Protocol:** The draft is in the RFC editor queue, with an expected release soon after being linked to another draft.
*   **Provisioning Domains for Proxy Configurations (Tommy):**
    *   The draft proposes using provisioning domain JSON format to communicate information about proxies.
    *   The format has been updated to include sub-dictionaries for proxy descriptions.
    *   Discussions included extensibility, mandatory keys, and exclusion domains.
    *   The group showed support for adoption.
*   **Utility Protocol Interfaces (Bill):**
    *   The presentation focused on clarifying ambiguities in RFC 8335 (PROBE protocol).
    *   Issues discussed included extension headers, data echoing, and user interface interpretation.
    *   The presenter has created tools for testing and debugging.
    *   Interrupt testing and adoption were considered for future steps.
*   **Extending ICMP for System Identification (Bill):**
    *   The presentation introduced a new ICMP extension for identifying systems with non-unique IP addresses.
    *   The goal is to provide a mechanism for routers to return node names or other identifying information.
    *   The presentation sought feedback and interest.
*   **SAVI Solution for Wireless LAN (Lynn):**
    *   The draft proposes a SAVI solution for wireless LANs using MAC addresses as binding anchors.
    *   MAC address randomization and integration with existing SAVI solutions were discussed.
    *   Questions were raised about the necessity of standardization and the differences from existing solutions.
*   **WPAD Update:** Josh presented an update to WPAD seeking feedback on new scenarios and discovery mechanisms.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Adopted:** draft-polling-intarea-proxy-config-pvd-02 was adopted as a working group document.
*   **Action Item:** Bill Fenner to send a reminder email to the mailing list to encourage review of his PROBE draft and ICMP Extension draft.
*   **Action Item:** Lynn Hu to refine the SAVI WLAN draft based on the comments received during the meeting, including consideration of DHCPv6 prefix delegation, MAC address randomization, and clarifying the differences from existing SAVI solutions.

## Next Steps

*   Review and discussion on the mailing list for the utility protocol interfaces draft and the ICMP extension for system identification.
*   Lynn Hu to continue refining the SAVI WLAN draft based on feedback.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list.
