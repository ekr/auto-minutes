## Summary

The SCIM working group session covered several key topics, including cursor pagination, use cases, SCIM events, Delta queries, and the SCIM device model. Discussions revolved around draft updates, feedback incorporation, and future steps for each area. Decisions were made regarding holding off on last call for SCIM events and requesting a security review for the SCIM device model.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Cursor Pagination:** The shepherd write-up is in progress, feedback is being incorporated, and the chairs will reach out to previous reviewers for confirmation of comment resolution.
*   **Use Cases:** A new version of the use cases draft has been revamped. Reviewers will be requested after the new version is uploaded.
*   **SCIM Events:** The latest draft (version 4) has been updated. A decision was made to hold off on working group last call until further discussions on shared signals are held.
*   **Delta Queries:** Work is focused on simplifying the solution by decoupling full scans and optimizing the delta query response structure (only modified attributes for updated resources).
*   **SCIM Device Model:** The FDO model has been implemented. A security review was requested, and versioning of extensions needs further input. Terminology review will be performed in collaboration with Pam and Paolo.
