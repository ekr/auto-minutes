## Summary
The SNAC (Stub Network Attachment Client) session was a joint meeting with DNSSD. Discussions covered the SNAC working group's progress, the stub router RA flag, simple document issues, and multi-link infrastructure. A significant portion of the session was dedicated to debating the best approach for standardizing the stub router RA flag. Concerns were raised about ensuring the flag is implemented correctly and how the MNO bits are handled. It concluded with action items related to the stub router RA flag and discussion on text related to preventing issues in managed networks.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Multiple Queue Types:** Ray presented on the multiple queue types draft, discussing the technical design of the EDNS option and whether to use one or two option codes (request/response). The discussion touched on potential amplification attacks and limiting the number of queue types.
*   **SRP Advertising Proxy:** Ted provided updates on the SRP advertising proxy, which scope had narrowed to focus only on the advertising proxy function. Concerns were raised about handling conflicts and the mandatory implementation of the TSR record. Using a subdomain for advertising proxy services was considered.
*   **SRP Replication:** Ted discussed updates to the SRP replication draft, highlighting that not much time has been dedicated to working on it and the remaining work to be done.
*   **Time Since Received:** Ted presented on Time Since Received, with emphasis on the problems they have experienced with previous versions and the new version's approach of discarding stale data.
*   **DNS Push:** Discussion of the proposal, which allows one to subscribe to a name and receive additional records when a new PTR record with that owner name is created.
*   **Working Group Progress:** Updates provided on progress since IETF 118, interim meetings, and goal to finalize the document by the next IETF meeting. A hackathon idea was proposed.
*   **Stub Router RA Flag Adoption:** Extensive discussion on the location of the RA Flag draft with potential for 6man adoption and concerns about how much detail is in the spec.
*   **Multi-Link Infrastructure:** Scoping of the multi-link infrastructure, with discussion of whether it would be better to skip it entirely.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Multiple Queue Types:** Ray will write a summary of the discussion to the group and propose dropping the two fields in favor of separate opcodes. This will be put to the working group for a consensus call.
*   **SRP (Post ISG Review):** The working group members will be notified to review the changes and have two weeks for review. 
*   **SRP Advertising Proxy:** Ted needs to implement TSR and see how well that goes
*   **Stub Router RA Flag Adoption:** Chairs to have an additional discussion regarding the RA Flag draft's location, consolidation and MNO implementations.
*   **Analysis of deployment scenarios:** Add an analysis of deployment scenarios

## Next Steps

*   Schedule interim meetings for SNAC and continue progress on SNAC simple.
*   Resolve stub router RA flag adoption decision.
*   Determine the scope of the multi-link infrastructure document or whether it should be pursued.
*   Complete discussion and action for issue in the SNAC Simple GitHub repository.
*   Ted will create an issue to track whether SRV/Text records can be provided with additional prefixes
