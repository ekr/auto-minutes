## Summary

The Network Management Operations (nmop) working group held its first session, focusing on incorporating operator input into the IETF process for network management. The meeting covered four main topics: Netconf/Yang Push integration, network anomaly detection, incident management, and updates to RFC 3535bis (an IAB workshop output on network management requirements). Discussions revolved around improving the deployment and interoperability of existing network management technologies, identifying gaps, and exploring potential solutions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Netconf/Yang Push Integration:** Discussed automating data processing chains using Yang Push and Apache Kafka, highlighting gaps in existing RFCs and proposed extensions. Concerns about semantics and managing data bursts were raised.
*   **Network Anomaly Detection:** Presented work on semantic metadata annotation and anomaly lifecycle management, emphasizing the need for collaboration and data exchange between operators and academia. The lifecycle included detection, tagging, validation, and refinement.
*   **Incident Management:** Discussed a Yang data model for network incident management and its relationship with anomaly detection. Highlighted the need for terminology alignment and potential collaboration with TMF.
*   **Issues related to deployment usage of young topology modules:** Addressed challenges in modeling networks using existing Yang topology models (RFC 8345), the complexities of numerous augmentations, and proposed starting work on RFC 8345bis to address identified gaps in bidirectional links and connections.
*   **Update RFC3535bis:**  Revisited the recommendations in the RFC 3535, looking at device model implementations and checking that it meets current network standards.  The conversation centered around automation and the challenges of working with multiple ecosystems.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Netconf/Yang Push Integration Document:** Request for more reviews on the mailing list before adoption.
*   **Incident Management and Anomaly Detection:** Encouraged authors of the incident management and anomaly detection drafts to work together to align their models and terminology
*   **Terminology Draft:** Proposed the adoption of the terminology draft as a working group document. Discussed broadening the scope to include terms relevant to action recovery following incident detection. Also suggested sending liaison statements to other groups like TMF to ensure better coordination.
*   **RFC 8345bis:** Decided to pursue work on RFC 8345bis and start with Nigel's draft on limitations. Plan to present progress at the next hackathon.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of Netconf/Yang Push integration document to solicit reviews on the mailing list.
*   Authors of Incident Management and Anomaly Detection documents to collaborate.
*   Adopt the terminology draft as a working group document and address outstanding comments (e.g., add "anomaly detection" definition).
*   Start work on RFC 8345bis for Yang Topology modules, including analysis of augmentations and considering RFC 8795.
*   Luis to start outreach with smaller operators.
