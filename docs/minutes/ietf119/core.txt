## Summary

This core working group session at IETF 119 covered a wide range of topics, including updates on existing documents, discussions on new proposals, and planning for future meetings. Key discussions revolved around Congestion control issues, DNS over CoAP, proxy functionalities, Oscar, and extending resource directories.  Several documents are nearing working group last call, while others require further refinement and implementation work.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **CoAP Congestion Control in Space:** Discussion of congestion control and appropriate parameters for CoAP in deep space environments, specifically regarding `mstart` and `acktimeout`. The need for congestion control in deep space was questioned and will be further discussed in the deep space side meeting.
*   **DNS over CoAP:** Discussion of readiness for working group last call.  Debate on whether to separate discovery options for DTLS vs. Oscar/ACE into separate documents.
*   **Protocol Indication:** Discussion around scheme names (coap vs coaps) with IP based transports. Seeking feedback on best handling of 6690 discovery.
*   **CoAP Group Communication with Proxies:** Discussion about the `reply-to` option and clarifying its functionality.
*   **Oscar-Capable Proxies:** Discussed the processing of incoming requests and the escalation of corporate protection.
*   **Oscar Key Update (Kudos):** Considerations for non-random Nonces and more flexible message flows and if message flows should target a specific resource.
*   **Nontraditional Responses:** Discussion on how nontraditional responses are handled in Oscar. Request to have the document adopted by the working group.
*   **Resource Structure Extensions:** Update and best options for the directory.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **DNS over CoAP:** The document is considered ready for working group last call, starting soon, after a two week period. Reviewers should request early reviews from directorate.
*   **Protocol Indication:** Get reviews of the appendicies.
*   **All:** Provide feedback on documents presented, especially regarding implementation experiences and security considerations.

## Next Steps

*   Continue interim meetings on a bi-weekly cadence, skipping one meeting in May.
*   Deep Space side meeting at IETF 119.
*   Further refine existing documents based on feedback received.
*   Continue implementation and interrupt testing efforts.
