<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This meeting covered several key aspects of network inventory modeling, including the current working group status, presentations on various data models, and discussions around defining the scope and boundaries of the inventory model. A recurring theme was the consideration of capabilities, features, and the interplay between physical and virtual elements within the inventory.  The applicability of the work within other IETF working groups and the potential formation of a new working group for green networking initiatives were also discussed.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working Group Status:</strong> The core model was adopted, and weekly calls focusing on the inventory core model are ongoing.</li>
<li><strong>BBF Liaison:</strong> Clarification was provided on the Broadband Forum's (BBF) network resource model and its relation to IETF work, particularly RFC 8345 and the inventory core model. A liaison response is being drafted, with a potential interim meeting if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Core Model:</strong> Updates to the core model draft were presented, including moving efficiency discussions to the appendix, clarifying terminology, adding a new root container for fiber and cable, and discussing configuration capabilities and part numbers.</li>
<li><strong>IV Boundary and Terminology:</strong>  A proposed boundary definition was presented, categorizing elements as physical, functional, informational, and motivational.  The goal is to clearly define what is in and out of scope for the inventory model, avoiding &quot;slippery slopes&quot; leading to excessive scope.</li>
<li><strong>Network Inventory Location Model:</strong> A presentation introduced a model to provide location information for network inventory, integrating general site information with rack-based details and extending the base inventory model.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Life Cycle Management and Operations:</strong> An overview of the draft focusing on asset life cycle management, aligning terminology (assets, entitlements, features) with TM Forum definitions, and integrating with the base inventory model.</li>
<li><strong>Young Data Model for Energy Saving Management:</strong> Presentation on a data model for power and energy management, integrating with existing network inventory and topology models to support energy efficiency strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Capabilities vs Features:</strong> There was a significant discussion on the definition and placement of capabilities within network models, including the potential for augmentations and the role of topology models. Different views were aired about whether capabilities should be included in the base model or as augmentations.</li>
<li><strong>Physical vs Virtual Inventory:</strong> Several participants emphasized considering virtual inventory, as well as physical. Some felt it was important not to restrict the models to physical assets only, as this would be shortsighted. However, others noted the difficulty in defining &quot;virtual&quot; in a way that constrained the scope adequately.</li>
<li><strong>Planning and Pre-provisioning:</strong> A use case for pre-provisioning devices was raised, requiring the model to represent devices before they are physically deployed.</li>
<li><strong>Re-use of terminology and code points:</strong> There were concerns that some code points were used multiple times, in different standards, that would require clarification.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Draft a liaison response to BBF, soliciting input on the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Send the proposed list of &quot;in scope&quot; and &quot;out of scope&quot; items for the inventory model to the mailing list for review.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Refine the definition of the inventory model boundary and agree upon it within the team.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Investigate the alignment of the energy saving management model with Tony's work.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> The proposed work on green networking initiatives should wait for the new working group to be formed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussions on terminology and use cases for the inventory core model.</li>
<li>Further explore the modeling of fiber and cable.</li>
<li>Address issues related to software patches.</li>
<li>Continue refining the inventory model boundary.</li>
<li>Consider the use case of pre-provisioning devices.</li>
</ul>
