## Summary

The WG Chairs Forum at IETF 119 covered a range of topics relevant to working group chairs, including HTTP Directorate reviews, outreach efforts, ISG work related to working group chairs, the IETF Community Survey, and managing complexity in the IETF process. Discussions focused on improving data collection, training, support, and participation within the IETF.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **HTTP Directorate:** Mark Nottingham highlighted the HTTP Directorate's role in reviewing documents using HTTP, emphasizing early engagement and alignment with best practices.
*   **Outreach:** Dhruv (EODR) provided an update on outreach activities, emphasizing the need for tracking working group and research group outreach efforts and community support. Justin Richard (whimsy) requested help in bridging his group with existing communities.
*   **ISG Work on WG Chairs:** Jay Daley presented the ISG's ongoing work related to working group chairs. Discussion points included:
    *   Skills development framework and training resources.
    *   Data collection on working group chairs (surveys, data tracker improvements) to facilitate informed decision-making by the ISG.
    *   Sharing opportunities for chair roles and addressing potential challenges related to chair turnover and selection.
*   **IETF Community Survey:** Jay Daley presented key findings from the IETF Community Survey, highlighting aspects of:
    *   Satisfaction with IETF processes and mission delivery.
    *   Importance of the IETF compared to other standards organizations.
    *   Motivations for participation (personal interest vs. business goals).
    *   Gender diversity and regional representation issues.
    *   Email preferences vs. other communication channels.
*   **Managing Complexity:** Jeff Hajz discussed managing complexity within the IETF process, emphasizing the importance of chair roles in shepherding new participants and reducing friction. He requested suggestions on how to reduce complexity and improve onboarding.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Justin Richard (whimsy) to send an email to the EODIR mailing list to discuss resources for bridging his group with existing communities.
*   **Action Item:** Attendees to provide feedback on the IETF Community Survey draft report to the ISG (directly or via ADs).
*   **Action Item:** ADs to consider periodically confirming chair willingness to continue in their roles.
*   **Suggestion:** IESG to send out how contributors can positively comment on the group's work to contributors directly.
*   **Suggestion:** ISG to consider a process adviser for working groups, who can unburden the AD from questions of novice chairs.

## Next Steps

*   ISG to analyze feedback on the IETF Community Survey and finalize the report.
*   ISG to continue developing the skills development framework and training resources for working group chairs.
*   EODR to explore methods for better tracking working group outreach activities.
*   Attendees to reflect on ways to reduce complexity within the IETF process and improve onboarding for new participants, potentially sharing ideas on the WG Chairs mailing list.
*   IESG to consider surveys/methods of acquiring new leaders who are not already working group chairs.
*   Training to improve chair knowledge for new participants, specifically in regards to IETF pipeline/processes.
