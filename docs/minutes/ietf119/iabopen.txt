## Summary
This IAB Open meeting included updates on IAB activities, liaison relationships, and reports from recent workshops. Key topics included the IETF's relationship with 3GPP, a report on the Bias Workshop, an introduction to Thread networking technology, and a discussion on the challenges of detecting known illegal material in end-to-end encrypted communications.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IAB Updates:** Recent RFC publications, Evolvability, Deployability, Maintainability (EDM) program, and Environmental Impact program were discussed. New liaison coordinators were announced.
*   **3GPP Liaison:** Charles Eckel provided an overview of the IETF's liaison relationship with 3GPP, focusing on mobile communications standards, coordination activities, liaison statement exchange, and dependency tracking of IETF documents within 3GPP specifications.
*   **Bias Workshop Report:** Maria Farrell presented a report on the Bias Workshop, which explored barriers to meaningful internet access, the digital divide, and censorship. Key takeaways included the need for guidance on running community networks, addressing the digital divide, and enhancing protocols for privacy and censorship circumvention.
*   **Thread Networking Technology:** Cert provided an overview of Thread, a low-power wireless networking technology designed for IP-based communication, particularly in home automation. He discussed the architecture, advantages, and the planned hackathon.
*   **Detecting Known Illegal Material:** Vanessa Teague gave an invited talk on techniques for detecting known illegal material in end-to-end encrypted communications, focusing on perceptual hashing and private set intersection protocols. She highlighted concerns about accuracy, transparency, and potential for abuse.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **EDM Program:** Schedule a virtual meeting in the next couple of months (doodle to be sent).
*   **Bias Workshop:** Publish the Bias Workshop report towards the IAB.
*   **Thread Hackathon:** Promote and organize the Thread hackathon at the next IETF meeting in Vancouver.

## Next Steps

*   Interested parties are encouraged to join the EDM program mailing list and participate in upcoming virtual meetings.
*   Review the Bias Workshop report and provide feedback.
*   Prepare for and attend the Thread hackathon in Vancouver to explore applications of the technology.
