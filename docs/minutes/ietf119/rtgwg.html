<h1>rtgwg Meeting - IETF 119, Brisbane</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The RTGWG meeting at IETF 119 covered a range of topics including updates on existing drafts, presentations on new proposals for multi-segment SD-WAN, remote failure protection, destination source routing, routing in satellite networks, application-aware networking, application-aware data center networking and lossless techniques in wider area networks. A key theme was the applicability of existing protocols and potential extensions for addressing emerging challenges in data centers and satellite networks. The group decided to take the proposal on satellite networking to the mailing list for discussion and potentially schedule an interim meeting.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net-to-Cloud Draft:</strong> An update was provided, highlighting Adrian Ferrell's review and the addition of new sub-TLVs. The group will take it to the list and get better reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Segment SD-WAN Draft:</strong> A show of hands indicated support for the use case, but the adoption vote showed less support. The chairs will take it to the list.</li>
<li><strong>Remote Failure Protection:</strong> The presentation introduced a framework for faster failure detection and repair, especially in data centers. Several participants questioned the performance gains compared to existing mechanisms and the applicability to BGP-only networks. The presenter was encouraged to send questions to the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Destination Source Routing:</strong> Presenters discussed the use cases, implementation status, and benefits of the draft. It was agreed to update the draft with implementation details and proceed with a working group adoption call.</li>
<li><strong>Routing on Satellite Networks:</strong> The presenter outlined a hierarchical routing architecture for LEO satellite constellations using ISIS with area proxies and SR MPLS for traffic engineering. There were concerns about scalability, overhead, handling of orbit inclinations, link failures, and the applicability of running a dynamic IGP on satellites with limited resources. Discussion ensued regarding the use of ephemeris data and potentially pre-computed routing.</li>
<li><strong>Application-Aware Networking (APN):</strong> An update was provided on the APN framework and its extension for application-side considerations. Chairs said the work is out of scope of the routing working group.</li>
<li><strong>Application-Aware Data Center Networks:</strong> The presentation highlighted use cases and requirements for better collaboration between networks and hosts in AI model training.</li>
<li><strong>Lossless WAN:</strong> Lossless transport for long distance links and discussion of the ineffectiveness of PFC in WAN due to scale.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net-to-Cloud Draft:</strong> Take it to the list and get better reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Segment SD-WAN Draft:</strong> Take it to the list.</li>
<li><strong>Remote Failure Protection:</strong> Presenter to send offline question and response to mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Destination Source Routing:</strong> Update the draft with implementation details and proceed with a working group adoption call.</li>
<li><strong>Routing on Satellite Networks:</strong> Chair to poll the working group for having a interim meeting on satellite networking and routing insights.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussions on the mailing list for the mentioned drafts.</li>
<li>Hold working group poll on having interim meeting on satellite networking.</li>
<li>Authors of destination source routing to update the draft with implementation details for working group adoption.</li>
</ul>
