## Summary
The Internet Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG) session featured presentations and discussions on congestion control evaluation suites, implicit congestion notification, and the adoption of the receive-like-that draft. Key topics included updating existing evaluation tools, the challenges of deploying new congestion control mechanisms in real-world networks, and the potential benefits and drawbacks of implicit congestion notification techniques.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **TCP Evaluation Suite Update:**
    *   Discussion on reviving and updating an existing TCP evaluation suite for fair comparisons of congestion control algorithms.
    *   Interest from the NS3 project in incorporating the suite.
    *   Debate on the inclusion of AQM and non-TCP congestion control mechanisms like QUIC.
*   **Implicit Congestion Notification (ICN):**
    *   Presentation of an ICN scheme that modifies acknowledgement packets to signal congestion without modifying the sender.
    *   Concerns raised about potential side effects of delaying acknowledgement packets, such as triggering retransmission timers or impacting HTTP resource loading.
    *   Discussion of using ECN bits instead of delaying packets for faster congestion feedback.
*   **Receive-Like-That Draft:**
    *   Update on the receive-like-that draft, which allows receivers to control congestion by adjusting the advertised receive window.
    *   Discussion on the draft's maturity and readiness for publication as an informational RFC.
*   **Call for Contribution:**
    *   David Hayes called for community contributions to the effort of updating the TCP evaluation suite, including defining test characteristics.
    *   Tom has is interested in people contributing to industry as well.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** David Hayes to send an email to the ICCRG mailing list to initiate a discussion group for updating the TCP evaluation suite.
*   **Decision:** Chairs to initiate a research group last call on the ICCRG mailing list for the receive-like-that draft.
*   **Action Item:** Initiate a poll to see who has read every revision of the draft now or that bad.
*   **Decision:** Move forward with publishing this document after last call concludes (assuming positive results).

## Next Steps

*   Establish a discussion group to coordinate the update of the TCP evaluation suite.
*   Conduct research group last call for the receive-like-that draft.
*   Evaluate comments from the last call and proceed with publishing the draft if appropriate.
