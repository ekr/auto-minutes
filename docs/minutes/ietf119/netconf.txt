# netconf

## Summary

The Netconf working group session at IETF 119 covered the status of ongoing drafts, including HTTP Notify, client-server suites, TLS 1.3, UDP client server, and drafts related to transaction IDs, private candidates, trace context, and configuration tracing.  Discussions included list pagination, private candidates, and unchartered items like Netconf Next and Rescon Next. There were presentations on hackathon results.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **HTTP Notify Draft:** Approved in telechat, awaiting RFC publication.
*   **Client Service Suite Drafts:** Seven of nine approved for publication request, with Netconf and Restconf client service suites needing IETF last call.
*   **List Pagination:** Cursor-based pagination, local-aware collation, and snapshot support discussed.  Request made for working group last call.
*   **Private Candidates:** Reworking wording and Restconf section; further review needed.
*   **Transaction ID:**  Ready for last call? Potential overlap with Private Candidates regarding conflict resolution needs consideration.
*   **Trace Context & Configuration Tracing:** No changes; proposed for last call.
*   **UDP Client Server:**  Discussion on remote address (hostname vs IP address) and dual stack support.
*   **UDP Notify:** Generic groupings removed; further discussion on list & use of UDP Client Server.
*   **Netconf Even Notifications:**  Defining the notification structure using a YANG module; requesting working group adoption.
*   **IETF YANG Library Augmentation:** Discussing whether to augment module states and whether to include the module set name as a key.
*   **List Pagination Snapshots:** Discussion on snapshot lifecycle, protection against denial-of-service attacks and performance constraints.
*   **Netconf Next / Rescon Next:** Interim meetings held; various backward compatible extensions in progress.  Looking for volunteers.
*   **Quick over NETCONF:** Interest expressed to enable quick connections over long delays.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **List Pagination:** Request for working group last call.
*   **Private Candidates:** Issue a version 3 draft, and discuss results on list especially around Restconf section.
*   **Transaction ID:**  Encourage people to read draft, then decide about last call. Investigate conflict area with private candidates.
*   **UDP Client Server:** Review remote address and dual stack support, and model after TCP client server.
*   **UDP Notify:** Send the 3 UDP drafts (Notify, Distributed Notify, UDP Client Server) to IETF list as a cluster.
*   **Netconf Even Notifications:** Kick off the adoption call.

## Next Steps

*   **List Pagination:**  Proceed with working group last call.
*   **Private Candidates:**  Issue v3 and review on list.
*   **Transaction ID:** Encourage review and resolve potential conflict areas.
*   **UDP Client Server:** Modify grouping based on TCP client server and comments at the meeting.
*   **UDP Notify:** Refine based on discussions and coordinate with other UDP drafts, then send to list.
*   **Netconf Even Notifications:** Kick off working group adoption call.
*   **List Pagination Snapshots:**  Discuss on list and gather more feedback.
*   **Netconf Next/Rescon Next:**  Facilitators assign work, editors to write drafts.
