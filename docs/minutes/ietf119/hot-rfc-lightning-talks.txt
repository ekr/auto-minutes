# Hot RFC Lightning Talks

## Summary
This session provided a platform for individuals to present ideas for new RFCs and solicit collaboration. Presenters had four minutes each to pitch their concepts, followed by offline discussion. Topics ranged from symmetric key exchange and DDoS mitigation to leveraging large language models and verifiable identity.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Symmetric Key Exchange (Matti Montania):** The presenter highlighted the need for standardizing symmetric key exchange mechanisms due to the potential vulnerabilities of asymmetric cryptography with the advent of quantum computing. They proposed a framework for symmetric key distribution and a standardized interface for applications consuming these keys.
*   **DDoS Mitigation (Lynnjo):** The discussion focused on the increasing frequency and sophistication of DDoS attacks, emphasizing the need for collaborative mitigation strategies. The presenter mentioned shortcomings of existing approaches and their ongoing work in DDoS mitigation.
*   **Large Language Models (LLMs) for Networking (From Jing Huang University):**  The presenter explored the potential of LLMs in networking, particularly in understanding network information and automating network management. An architecture called "LLM in the loop" was introduced.
*   **Standalone Service Identification in IP Networks (Tony, Frontera Corporation):** The presentation argued for a unified interface between IP networks and application layers, using a standalone service identification for the full service lifecycle.
*   **Threat Surface Management of Network Elements (Frank, Huawei):**  The speaker emphasized the growing risk of attacks targeting network infrastructure directly. They proposed a common proposal for network element threat surface management.
*   **Universal Name System (UNS) and Universal Certificate Authority (UCA) (Maddie Fontaine, Hashmash):** An update on a system based on confidential computing, aiming for a global, verifiable information infrastructure with zero trust.
*   **Certificate Hashing for Root Certificate Validation (Robo Muming, Remote):** The presenter addressed the current situation with certificates and root certificates, suggesting hashing certificates of roots of Certification Authorities.
*   **Humanitarian ICT Support (Timothy Horban):** The discussion focused on building humanitarian ICT support for technologists working in the peace domain, suggesting a classification for humanitarian ICT workers.
*   **Agent Discovery Profile (Timothy Horban):** The presenter spoke about having a basic file attached to the domain to help provide context and make that discoverable.
*   **Adaptive Video and Traffic Shaping (Matt Juris, Meta):** The presentation addressed the intersection of adaptive video streaming and traffic shaping. They proposed limiting video quality directly instead of using shapers.
*   **Large Language Models and Personal Data (Adrian Grumper, Remote):**  The talk explored the intersection of LLMs and personal data, specifically in the context of delegated authorization and standards like Ganapp.
*   **Verifiable Identity using Distributed Authentication (Neil Crowitz):** The presentation introduced Vita, a system based on DKIM for reliably attributing content to an author using DNS and public-private key pairs.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **BOF Meeting for Symmetric Key Exchange:** Matti Montania is seeking support to organize a BOF meeting during the next IETF meeting in Vancouver.
*   **Side Meetings:** Several side meetings were announced for further discussion on specific topics:
    *   Symmetric Key Exchange: Tuesday and Wednesday at 3 PM in Brisbane.
    *   LLMs for Networking: Wednesday afternoon at 4 PM.
    *   Standalone Service Identification: Tuesday night at 6:30 PM.
    *   Universal Name System and Universal Certificate Authority: Tomorrow at 2PM.
    *   Adaptive Video and Traffic Shaping: Thursday, Session 1 (BOF).
    *   Ganapp meeting is on Wednesday.

## Next Steps

*   Interested individuals should contact the presenters of topics they find relevant to collaborate on drafts and further development.
*   Those interested in specific proposals (e.g., Symmetric Key Exchange BOF, PDAP mail list) should engage with the respective mailing lists or contacts provided.
*   Explore collaboration for converting long essays into succinct RFC format (Neil Crowitz).
