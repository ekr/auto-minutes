## Summary

The BMWG session covered updates on working group status, discussions on multiple working group drafts, and proposals for new benchmarking methodologies. Key topics included MLR search efficiency, container infrastructure benchmarking, a YANG model for network tester management, multiple IP address usage in benchmarking, segment routing benchmarking, power consumption benchmarking in network devices, and service benchmarking guidelines.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **MLR Search Draft:** Presentation on version 6, highlighting improvements in content, clarification of problem addressing, and consistency in language. Discussion focused on applicability and results, particularly within Linux Foundation Networking's fast data IO VPP.  Need for review and a possible last call was expressed.
*   **Container Infrastructure Benchmarking Draft:** Discussion on networking models, repeatable environment setup, and economic coping considerations. Feedback requested to refine the document and move towards adoption.
*   **YANG Model for Network Tester Management:** Presentation on the progress and latest status of the YANG model, emphasizing simplicity and focus on stateless traffic generation and analysis. Mention of pre-silicon gate-level simulation and hackathon achievements. Discussed controller integration and out of scope protocol configurations.
*   **Multiple IP Addresses in Benchmarking Tests:** Rationale for testing with multiple IP addresses was explained, along with a recommended solution to address unfairness issues. Measurement results comparing fixed vs. random IP addresses were presented.
*   **Segment Routing Benchmarking Methodology:** Document consolidation and the merging of MPLS and IPv6 drafts into a single document.  Desire to move towards adoption, and suggestions to socialize to SPRING working group.
*   **Power Consumption Benchmarking in Network Devices:** Discussion about metrics and test conditions to characterize benchmarking of power consumption, and to ensure that the energy efficiency measurements made were repeatable.
*   **Service Benchmarking Guidelines:** Introduction of a new document proposing benchmarking methodology for SRv6 and SR-MPLS forwarding planes, highlighting the expected throughput for different roles. The proposed guideline includes the idea to test several types of services in the SR network.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **MLR Search Draft:** Authors to add a note about the controller specific configuration protocol being out of scope for now. Chairs will discuss last call request pending reviews on the mailing list.
*   **Container Infrastructure Benchmarking Draft:** Continue discussion on the mailing list.
*   **Segment Routing Benchmarking Methodology:** Chairs will discuss with Sarah about initiating the adoption process.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address comments and feedback on their respective drafts.
*   Working group participants to review drafts and provide feedback on the mailing list.
*   Chairs to discuss and initiate adoption calls for drafts that are ready.
