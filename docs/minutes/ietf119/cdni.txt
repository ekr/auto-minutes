## Summary

This IETF meeting covered several key aspects of the CDNI architecture, including updates on existing drafts, discussion of new draft proposals, and the path forward for adoption and last call. The discussions included topics such as triggers, capacity, logging, footprints, metadata expression language, and source metadata. Key discussion points revolved around extending functionalities, ensuring interoperability, and addressing potential issues related to time zone handling and security.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RFC 9538 Publication:**  Congratulations were extended to authors for the publication of RFC 9538 (ACME, TLS delegation).
*   **Last Calls:** Updates on last calls for delegate credentials draft (ends in one week) and capability advertisement extension draft (ends in two weeks).
*   **Triggers Interface (2nd Edition):**
    *   Updates on changes from version 9 to version 11, primarily focusing on cleanup, grammatical, and spelling corrections.
    *   Discussion on the choice of using "date local time" versus ISO 8601, raising concerns about time zone shifts. Agreement to add clarification text in the specification.
    *   Outline of next steps including a version 12 for minor cleanups and a version 13 for Alan's proposed suggestions.
*   **Capacity Advertisement Extension:** Nearing completion, with a last call in progress. Minor updates planned based on Sanjay's comments.
*   **CDNI Logging:**
    *   Introduction of a new logging draft that addresses gaps in RFC 7937, including support for various formats (JSON, CSV, whitespace, Protobuf) and transport mechanisms (pull and push).
    *   Discussion of container metadata to include context alongside the logs.
    *   Presentation of transform operations for redacting sensitive information.
    *   Request for working group adoption.
*   **Trigger Scope Extension:**
    *   Presentation of a proposal to extend the trigger scope, including object lists, prioritization, dependencies, labeling, URL type handling, RESTful API, CIT triggers, and CCM path handling.
    *   Discussion on handling priorities and potential denial reasons.
*   **Name Footprints:** Discussion about introducing named footprints to define various geographies.
*   **Configuration Metadata:**
    *   Discussion of a suite of configuration metadata extensions to RFC 8006 including Metadata Expression Language, Processing Stages Metadata, Source Metadata Extended, Client Access Control, Edge Control Metadata, Delivery Metadata and Private Features Metadata.
    *   Clarification on usage of CDN terminology for transitive CDNs.
    *   Presentation of Source Metadata Extended with focus on load balancing and origin detention.
    *   Request for protocol type assignments for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
    *   Discussion on the generic nature of Private Features Metadata and potential alternatives.
*   **Protected Secrets Metadata:** Discussion about minor changes and addition of sequence diagrams.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Triggers Interface:** Jay to create version 12 with minor cleanups, and version 13 for Alan's proposals. Clarification text to be added regarding time zone shift edge cases.
*   **CDNI Logging:** Ben requested working group adoption. Chairs to evaluate and decide.
*   **Trigger Scope Extension:** Alan to work with Jay to incorporate the changes into future versions of the trigger interface draft. Timeline: Aim for a proposal at IETF 121 and a draft before IETF 120.
*   **Name Footprints:** Alan requested working group adoption.
*   **Configuration Metadata:** Requests for working group adoption and last call for various drafts. Action to assign reviewers. Glen will post list to distribution to start getting consensus.
*   **Charter Scope:** Chairs to review the proposed drafts and determine if they fit within the existing charter scope or if rechartering is required.
