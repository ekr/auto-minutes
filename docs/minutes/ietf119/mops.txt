## Summary

The MOPS session covered working group document updates and industry updates from the Streaming Video Technology Alliance (SVTA). A key focus was a preliminary report from the SVTA on operational impacts caused by network overlays, such as Apple Private Relay, on CDN and video service delivery.  The discussion highlighted issues related to routing, protocol changes, DNS changes, address changes, latency measurement, and cache selection.  The SVTA plans to document these problems and bring them back to the IETF for further engagement and potential specification changes.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Updates:**  The "Media Operations Use Case and Extended Reality Application on Edge Computing Infrastructure" document is in IETF last call. The 3DN document has finished working group last call and is with the document shepherd.
*   **SVTA Update:** Glenn Dean presented on work within the SVTA related to network overlays and their impact on video streaming.  He highlighted issues related to:
    *   Routing policy changes affecting cache selection.
    *   Latency measurement tools becoming ineffective due to differing paths for application traffic vs. measurement tools.
    *   Network overlays being invisible to applications.
    *   Different behaviors for HTTP vs HTTPS traffic in overlay networks, impacting cache selection and performance.
    *   Lack of EDNS0 support in some overlay networks affecting cache selection.
*   **Network Policy Changes:** Concerns were raised about how policy changes on network overlays can impact video delivery.
*   **Overlays & Privacy:** It was clarified the goal wasn't to undo privacy initiatives, but to ensure that workflows for other services work with them.
*   **Overlays are Everywhere:** The discussion noted that these issues occur with other kinds of overlays or tunnels.
*   **ICN:** Concern was raised about ICN. It was clarified the SVTA work is primary for HTTP based manifest streaming.
*   **Scope:** It was suggested the work should focus on some very specific things such as CD and cash selection.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **SVTA Action:** The SVTA will continue to document the operational problems caused by network overlays.
*   **SVTA Action:** The SVTA will draft an informational document outlining these issues.
*   **Mops Action:** The working group will plan a more in-depth discussion and presentation of the SVTA findings at IETF 120.  An Internet-Draft (I-D) may result.
*   **Mops Action:** Ensure the SVTA draft is announced to the relevant IETF communities.

## Next Steps

*   The SVTA will continue its work on documenting the operational impacts of network overlays.
*   Glenn Dean will present the SVTA's findings and potentially an I-D at IETF 120.
*   Mops will engage with other relevant IETF working groups (e.g., those dealing with IP tunneling, VPNs, DNS, and policy) to address the broader implications of network overlays on media delivery.
