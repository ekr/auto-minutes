<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 22 Mar 2024 05:00</p>
<h1>mediaman</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This mediaman meeting focused on the definition and usage of media type suffixes, particularly multiple suffixes, and the implications for interoperability and security.  The discussion centered around a proposal to register several media types with multiple suffixes, specifically related to JSON-LD, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Concerns were raised about the lack of clear guidance on the meaning and appropriate use of suffixes, leading to potential misuse and ambiguity. The meeting concluded with an action plan to investigate the feasibility of removing suffixes from related specifications and the definition of next steps for several registry related tasks.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Suffix Meaning and Usage:</strong>  The core issue revolves around the lack of clear definitions and guidelines for media type suffixes. Concerns were voiced that the proliferation of suffixes, especially multiple suffixes, without well-defined semantics could lead to confusion, interoperability problems, and even security vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Suffixes:</strong>  The specific use case of multiple suffixes (e.g., <code>+ld+json</code>) was debated.  There was disagreement on whether these suffixes provided meaningful information or were simply conventions for naming.</li>
<li><strong>Existing Registrations:</strong> Concerns about existing registered suffixes, some of which might be misused (e.g., <code>+gzip</code>), which led to suggestions for reviewing and potentially re-evaluating their usage.</li>
<li><strong>JSON-LD, DIDs, and VCs:</strong>  The need to register media types for JSON-LD, DIDs, and VCs with multiple suffixes has driven the discussion.  However, there is reluctance to register these types without addressing the fundamental issues surrounding suffixes.</li>
<li><strong>Backward Compatibility:</strong> Changing the media type conventions for JSON-LD would create a compatibility problem because it has been deployed for a while.</li>
<li><strong>Proposed Solutions:</strong> Several solutions were proposed, including:
<ul>
<li>Documenting use cases for suffixes and providing guidance on appropriate usage.</li>
<li>Grandfathering in existing registrations for JSON-LD, DIDs, and VCs, but discouraging future use.</li>
<li>Treating plus signs and dashes as equivalent and removing the special meaning of suffixes.</li>
<li>Removing suffixes from all related specifications (JSON-LD, VC, DID) and use dashes instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Investigate the feasibility and impact of removing plus signs (suffixes) from all related specifications (JSON-LD, VC, DID) and using dashes instead. This will be discussed on the relevant mailing lists. (Owner: mediaman working group)</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong>  Harold to facilitate introduction to write people at the W3C for discussion about potential impact of the change. (Owner: Harold)</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Escalate organization's documents and ID that have expired to the working group. Working group to plus call for it.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Create a repository for the registration document and find an editor to start the rewrite process. Update the registry with the &quot;instructions to the reviewer to the type review.&quot; (Owner: mediaman working group)</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong>  Magnus Westerland to update registry with RTP metadata, and delete the old one. (Owner: Magnus Westerland)</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Get a list from Manu of the types they want grandfathered. (Owner: Manu)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion on Mailing Lists:</strong>  The potential for removing suffixes and using dashes will be discussed on the relevant mailing lists.</li>
<li><strong>Liaison with W3C:</strong> Coordination with the W3C will be initiated to assess the impact of changes on JSON-LD, DIDs, and VCs.</li>
<li><strong>Revisit Suffix Definition:</strong>  The mediaman working group will revisit the fundamental definition and purpose of media type suffixes.</li>
<li><strong>Document Review:</strong>  Review existing RFCs for registry related updates.</li>
</ul>
