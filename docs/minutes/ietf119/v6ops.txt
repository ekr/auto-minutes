# v6ops

## Summary

The v6ops meeting covered a variety of IPv6 deployment and operational topics. Presentations included updates on IPv6-only network deployments, multi-homing solutions, extension header implementation, renumbering challenges, and the impact of IPv6 on the DNS. A key theme was the need to address practical deployment issues and operational challenges faced by network operators.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IPv6-Only Networks:**  Updates on deploying IPv6-only networks and the importance of transition mechanisms like CLAT and DNS64/Prefix64.  Discussion around the requirements for IPv6-only capable devices.
*   **Multi-Homing:**  Analysis of available multi-homing solutions for business sites, including native IPv6 solutions and translation-based approaches. Discussion of a survey regarding multi-homing configuration practices.
*   **Extension Headers:** Implementation of IPv6 extension headers using eBPF for network diagnostics and routing efficiency. Performance benchmarking compared to kernel implementation.
*   **Renumbering:** The problem of renumbering in different environments (ISP, Enterprise) and its implications on host address selection, including the limitations of rule 55.  A proposal to make the router's link-local address dependent on assigned prefixes.
*   **CLAT and IPv6 Transition:** The challenges and "gotchas" of CLAT (Customer-side NAT64) deployment. Discussed problems about preferring IPv4 versus CLAT when the former is available. Importance of IPv6 addresses to implement stateless for tons of reasons.
*   **v6 Mostly Deployment:** Discussion of benefits of doing v6 mostly deployments, compared to IPv6 only. Focus on using Prefix64 instead of DNS64. 
*   **DNS and IPv6:**  Measurement data on IPv6 support and performance in the DNS.  The prevalence of dual-stack resolvers and the lack of a strong IPv6 preference. The impact of fragmentation on DNSSEC and the need to avoid large UDP packets over IPv6.
*   **CE Router Update:** Review of draft update to RFC 7084, covering basic RFC updates, removal of transition text, and recommendations for ingress filtering. Discussion of incorporating PCP (Port Control Protocol) and NTP.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Home Gateway Prefix Delegation Document:** Tim Winters' document on prefix delegation for home gateways is ready for working group last call.
*   **Adopt CLAT Recommendations Document:** Tommy Jensen's document on CLAT recommendations appears to have achieved working group consensus for adoption.
*   **Consider Adoption of Renumbering Draft:** Jen's draft on link-local addressing based on prefixes may be useful. The document is for consideration of adoption.

## Next Steps

*   **Evaluate `evn6` placement.** Discuss with the authors of the `evn6` draft, and the chairs to evaluate whether the document suits the working group, or should be moved elsewhere.
*   **Further discussion and clarification needed on renumbering draft** Tim Winters to coordinate off-list with Jen on the content of the Renumbering draft.
*   **Focus on Native Solutions for Multi-Homing:**  Re-evaluate the language regarding the native and translation based Multi-Homing solutions, to discourage the latter.
*   **Discuss DNS preferences:** Schedule a discussion about preferences for preferring IPv4 versus CLAT/NAT64 when both are available.
