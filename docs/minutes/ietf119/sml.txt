## Summary
The SML working group meeting covered structured vacation notices, use cases for structured data in email, and the main SML specification.  Key discussions included adoption of the vacation notice draft, the role of vCards in vacation notice representation, security and privacy considerations across various SML use cases, and the relationship between structured data and human-readable content in emails.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Vacation Notices:**  Discussion on adopting the structured vacation notice draft and the appropriateness of including vCard representations. Pete suggested representing vacation information as a calendar object (iCalendar/jCal), which could include vCard or jCard data for replacement persons.
*   **Use Cases:** Explored various use cases for structured data in email, including confirmation codes, shared media/locations, emoji reactions, newsletters, and service subscription management. Privacy and security implications were highlighted, particularly regarding forwarding of sensitive data.
*   **Implementation Guidance:**  Concerns raised about automatic extraction of confirmation codes from emails and the potential for abuse.
*   **Core Specification:** Discussed how to embed structured data in emails (multipart vs. embedded JSON-LD). Investigation into alternative approaches.
*   **Full vs. Partial Representation:** Explored the distinction between structured data as a full representation of email content versus a partial annotation of the human-readable part. Focus on how to handle cases where structured data is removed from the email context.
*   **Relationship to Other Messages:** Discussed how structured data relates to other messages, including forwarding and replying.
*   **Supersedes Header:** Discussed the supercedes header and potential issues arising with the processing of updated data.
*    **Server-Side Flags:** Should the email server and or multiple clients be notified that structure data has been processed already?
*    **Security and Privacy:** Repeated calls for addressing security and privacy in the use case doc and core specification.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Adoption Call:** The chair will initiate an adoption call on the mailing list for the structured vacation notice draft.
*   **Code Contributors:** A request for code contributions to the SML document.
*   **Cochair Position:** Murray looking for another person to fill the cochair role.
*   **Trust and Security Draft:** Further review of the trust and security document is needed. Consider merging it with the core specification.
*   **CID Recommendation:** The document should default on the current CIG recommendation from the last revision and should be confirmed via email.

## Next Steps

*   Investigate alternative approaches to embedding structured data in emails (Murray volunteered).
*   Continue discussion on identifiers, specifically how to use the supersedes historic header.
*   Address security and privacy considerations in both the use case document and the core specification, taking into account feedback on separating trust and security from the core spec.
*    Review and provide feedback on open issues in the core draft.
*   Review text and address to security concerns in each use case and the forwarding of PII.
*   Continue discussion on a sieve extension to the core data to assist in applying rules to the data.
