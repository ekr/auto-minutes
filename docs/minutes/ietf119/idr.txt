## Summary

The IDR working group session covered several draft proposals related to BGP extensions. Key topics included generic metric extensions for BGP, extensions for IPv4/IPv6 mapping advertisements, segment routing extensions, BGP egress engineering, and flow specification enhancements. The session also touched upon securing inter-domain routing with FCBGP and source address validation using flow specifications.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Generic Metric Extensions for BGP:** Discussion focused on introducing generic metric extensions for BGP using the Next-Hop Dependent Capability Attribute (NHC). The goal is to support intent-based end-to-end paths with various metrics like delay, bandwidth, and administratively assigned metrics. Discontinuity issues were addressed, and the use of NHC for scoping was highlighted.
*   **MBGP Extensions for IPv4/IPv6 Mapping Advertisements:** This presentation covered MBGP extensions (6map46) for carrying IPv4 attributes over IPv6 networks to facilitate transition technologies across multiple autonomous systems. Revisions and operational considerations were discussed.
*   **Segment Routing BGP Extensions:** Updates to a draft defining new segment sub-TLVs for providing optional algorithms for SMPS adjacencies were presented. Remote node address interface requirements were clarified.
*   **Segment Routing BGP Egress Engineering over L2 Bundles:** The session discussed BGP peer adjacency segment advertisement over layer 2 bundles for traffic steering purposes. Modifications to existing RFCs were proposed.
*   **BGP Extensions of SR Policy for Head-end Behavior:** This presentation introduced extensions for specifying head-end behaviors for SRv6 policies, including new sub-TLVs for layer 3 and layer 2 traffic.
*   **BTPIs s s as a policy for, PE:** Reporting the Network Resource Partition associated with an SR Policy Candidate Path via BGPLs.
*   **BGP link state For the Advertisement of an RPA information in a scalable way:** NRP is, a collection of natural resources allocated on a set of links in a neural network network.
*   **Dissemination of beach flow stack rules for APN:** Propose a new component type for APN. And, the discussion about flows spec V2
*   **FCBGP:** A novel secure inter domain routing protocol, it has built upon a unified, preventive called the verifiable intent, and it's fully compatible with the BGP and incrementally deployable by offering strictly, positive security benefits.
*   **Destination IP Community Filter for BGP flow specification:** Proposing a new BGP flows by component type. To support the community level filtering.
*   **Beach b flow spec for source address validation:** Extend the flows back to support of mushrooms, interfaces, to used to check The sauce addresses of a package.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Generic Metric Extensions for BGP:** The author requested working group comments and asked the chairs to consider the draft for adoption. Send adoption requests to the mailing list.
*   **MBGP Extensions for IPv4/IPv6 Mapping Advertisements:** The authors will incorporate comments received and refine the draft.
*   **Segment Routing BGP Extensions:** The authors will prepare for a second working group adoption call.
*   **Segment Routing BGP Egress Engineering over L2 Bundles:** The authors will add a header indicating that the draft modifies existing RFCs. They will also sync over and send my response to the mail list
*   **BGP Extensions of SR Policy for Head-end Behavior:** The authors will have conversations with those authors and look at the status of head and insert behaviors.
*   **BTPIs s s as a policy for, PE:** The author will check with T's chair to check applicability is being appropriately met.
*   **BGP link state For the Advertisement of an RPA information in a scalable way:** the author will address and make that clear about the relationship with IGP.
*   **FCBGP:** The author has committed to expanding this section in a future version
*   **Destination IP Community Filter for BGP flow specification:** The author will add a session to describe a flow spike work tool extension of our destination IP community filter.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to incorporate feedback and update drafts.
*   Chairs to assess the readiness of drafts for working group adoption.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for clarification and further refinement of proposals.

# idr Session

## Summary
The IDR session covered several important topics including the current document status, updates on VPN prefix outbound filter (VPNOF), a YANG model for RPKI, BGP extensions for 5G edge services, and a proposal for a packet content filter for BGP flow specification (FlowSpec). The session included discussions on adoption calls, working group last calls, and the planned approach for FlowSpec V2.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Document Status:** Completed car and CT work, pending working group last call for send hold timer. Working group is planning a call on CPR. Discussion regarding cleaning up old IDR documents without implementations.
*   **FlowSpec V2:** A new approach to FlowSpec V2 development will be adopted, focusing on breaking the larger document into smaller, implementable pieces. This includes basic IP flow spec, more IP filters, actions, and non-IP considerations. Dedicated teams will be formed to discuss each aspect.
*   **VPN Prefix Outbound Filter (VPNOF):** Updates presented including a new extended community for source PE identification and refinements to the processing method of the receipt or I've entry by the receiver and increase to VPN prefix limit length. Two implementations exist.
*   **YANG Model for RPKI:** Four YANG models were presented covering configuration and management of RPKI routing protocols, origin validation, BPsec pass validation, and ASPA validation. Discussion on where this document belongs, given overlaps with side-rep.
*   **BGP Extensions for 5G Edge Services:** Updates on the metadata pass attribute for 5G edge services, including use cases, TLVs, and one implementation report. Discussed the use of route targets to represent groups of services. Discussion around the broadness of the metadata attribute.
*   **Packet Content Filter for FlowSpec:** A proposal for a packet content filter for BGP FlowSpec was presented to mitigate volumetric DDoS attacks. This filter would allow matching on packet content beyond predefined fields.
*   **Review of Prior Work (IETF 110 Slides):** Prior work on position based detection including implementation challenges was presented for context.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **VPNOF:** Draft added to working group last call queue. Details on implementation report and Shepherd's check to be sent to the author.
*   **YANG Model for RPKI:** ADs and chairs will discuss the document's organization, specifically whether to keep it as a single document or split it into multiple documents.
*   **BGP Extensions for 5G:** Authors to consider adding scoping and applicability guidelines to the draft, and to consider alternative names for the attribute.
*   **Flowspec Teams:** Initial meetings for flowspec teams will be announced.

## Next Steps
*   Authors of the drafts mentioned should address the comments and suggestions from the working group.
*   Interested parties should join the FlowSpec V2 discussion groups/teams.
*   Chairs will schedule working group last calls for approved drafts.
