## Summary

The Quantum Internet Research Group (QIRG) meeting featured four presentations: routing in quantum networks, timing regimes for quantum networks, an update on the multiplane architecture proposal for the quantum internet, and link-level multiplexing. Discussions covered terminology, protocol design, and practical considerations for building quantum networks.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Routing in Quantum Networks:** Explored routing strategies, analogous to classical networking, including proactive, reactive, virtual, and opportunistic routing. Swapping strategies (synchronous, asynchronous, opportunistic) and fidelity support (passive vs. active) were also discussed.
*   **Timing Regimes for Quantum Networks:**  Identified critical timing regimes for quantum network components, including quantum optics (interferometric stabilization, photon overlap), hardware (detector timing, measurement basis selection, optical switch control), and software (event-driven tasks, application-level tasks, background tasks).
*   **Multiplane Architecture for the Quantum Internet:** Provided an update on a framework for the quantum internet, focusing on agility, sustainability, and playability. The proposed architecture leverages SDN principles and includes synthetic environments for testing.
*   **Link Level Multiplexing Mechanism:** Presented a multiplexing mechanism to resolve inconsistencies in resource allocation in multi-connection scenarios. The mechanism uses link allocation updates and barrier messages to align timing.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Michael and Siridi:** Share the draft on advertising entanglement properties in OSPF/ISIS on the QIRG mailing list and in the chat.
*   **Shoti:** Share the URL for the link allocation update specification on the QIRG mailing list and in the chat.
*   **Diego:** Incorporate presentation feedback in the next draft of the multiplane architecture proposal.
*   **Rodney and Wojtek:** Coordinate to decide on the timing and location of the next QIRG meeting, focusing on Vancouver and Dublin. The mailing list will be updated.

## Next Steps

*   The work on identifying what roles the different strata planes play will continue.
*   Further development of the synthetic environment for experimentation.
*   Vancouver and Dublin will be considered for future meetings, with Dublin being the stronger contender at present.
*   Feedback on the multiplane architecture proposal is requested from the QIRG mailing list.
