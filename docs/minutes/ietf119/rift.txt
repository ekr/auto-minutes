## Summary

This session focused on two main topics: an update on the rift base specification and a discussion regarding a new charter for the working group. Jordan provided an update on version 20 of the rift base spec, highlighting the editorial and structural improvements made based on AD and reviewer feedback.  The chairs then presented a proposed new charter, including additional areas of work like key-value stores, segment routing, and AI/ML applications. The group discussed the scope of the proposed charter and the importance of prioritization.

## Key Discussion Points
