# Hackathon Kickoff

## Summary
The Hackathon Kickoff provided instructions and information to participants. Topics covered included presentation submission guidelines, utilizing the data tracker for linking implementations to drafts, the hack demo session, code lounge reservations, and acknowledging sponsors.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Presentation Submission:** Participants were instructed on how to upload presentations to the IETF 119 presentations repository. Acceptable formats are PDF or HTML, with HTML converted to PDF. Access to upload requires being part of the IETF Hackathon organization on GitHub. Participants were asked to send their GitHub handles to hackathonchairs@ietf.org.
*   **Data Tracker: Additional Resources:** Authors of drafts were encouraged to utilize the "additional resources" field in the data tracker to link implementations, websites, or other relevant information to their drafts. Individual draft authors can edit the field; working group draft authors must request changes through the chairs.
*   **Hack Demo Session:** A demo session is scheduled for Monday evening from 6:30 to 7:30 to present projects. Participants must register before noon on Monday to ensure sufficient capacity.
*   **Code Lounge:** Participants can reserve tables in the code lounge (Terminal Room) to continue working on projects during the week. A link to the code lounge registration is available on the Hackathon wiki.
*   **Sponsors:** Acknowledgment of the Hackathon sponsors: Ericsson (Gold), Metaswitch (Silver), CNNIC and ICANN (Bronze).
*   **Project Visibility:** Participants were asked to add their project and table number to the whiteboard to facilitate finding them.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Action Item:** Participants to send their GitHub handles to hackathonchairs@ietf.org to gain upload access to the presentation repository. Deadline: Today.
*   **Decision:** Use PDF or HTML formats for presentations.
*   **Action Item:** Participants to register for the Hack Demo Session on Monday before noon.
