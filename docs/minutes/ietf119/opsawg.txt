## Summary

This meeting covered updates on several working group drafts, including data manifest, attachment circuits, simple IPFIX fixes, UCR model, schedule young model, power management in routers, signatures for YANG, OAM terminology, and GTPU protocol identification. Discussions included normative references, alignment with other drafts, working group adoption, and future directions. The area directors also provided updates and welcomed new leadership.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Data Manifest:** Discussion on normative references and alignment with other drafts.
*   **Attachment Circuits:** Updates on young doctor reviews and modifications for BGP capability negotiation. Proposal for working group last call after incorporating examples and RTG reviews.
*   **Simple IPFIX Fixes:** Updates on working group last call and expert reviews, focusing on TCP and IPv6 session headers.
*   **UCR Model:** Dependency on schedule young model and the need for alignment.
*   **Schedule Young Model:** Proposal for working group adoption and discussion on placement in NetMod vs. OpsAWG.
*   **Power Management in Routers:** Presentation of a new draft on power consumption and control in routers, discussion on granularity and potential for a new working group focused on green networking.
*   **Signatures for YANG:** Updates on closing methods and ongoing proof of concept, plan for Hackathon participation.
*   **OAM Terminology:** Discussion on consistent terminology for inbound and out-of-band OAM, call for working group adoption after further discussion on the mailing list.
*   **GTPU Protocol Identification:** Introduction of new IPFIX information elements for GTPU, request for IPFIX allocation and working group adoption after further discussion.
*   **Area Director Updates:** Rob Wilson's outgoing remarks and Mahesh Jethanandani's incoming plans, including focus on YANG model interoperability, adoption, and the evolution of RFC 3535.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Data Manifest:** Authors to work on the young modeling issue and align with the Philatelist draft.
*   **Attachment Circuits:** Await routing director reviews and release a new version with examples before proposing working group last call.
*   **UCR Model:** Align with the schedule young model before moving to last call.
*   **Schedule Young Model:** Present in NetMod or coordinate with Kent Watson regarding conditional enablement. Consider discussing the best working group to be in.
*   **Power Management in Routers:** Discuss with ADs and the RB working group to harmonize efforts.
*   **OAM Terminology:** Post to mailing list to generate more discussion regarding which terminology to use.
*   **GTPU Protocol Identification:** Continue the discussion on the mailing list about this draft.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of various drafts to address open issues and comments.
*   Further discussion on the mailing lists for OAM Terminology and GTPU Protocol Identification.
*   Exploration of a new working group for green networking.
*   Transition of area directorship from Rob Wilson to Mahesh Jethanandani.
