## Summary

The dmm working group meeting at IETF 111 covered several key topics, including updates on working group documents related to mobility-aware transport network slicing and service-based mobile use of IPv6. Individual draft presentations included discussions on map architecture updates, computing-aware traffic steering, mobile user plane evolution, public capability negotiation, and emergency calling.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Mobility-Aware Transport Network Slicing:** Discussion on the draft focused on removing technology-specific details (PPR) and referencing relevant 5G and transport slicing drafts (TEAS).  The use of UDP source port for control plane slicing was discussed, clarifying that it's an operator-internal mechanism, not a user-facing service.  The lack of implementation was debated, with the authors arguing it solves a problem where layer 2 info cannot be transferred. The suggestion to present the draft to the TEAS working group was raised. A liaison to 3GPP (CT and SA5) was proposed.
*   **Map Architecture Update:** Satoru presented updates to the map architecture draft, emphasizing its data plane independence. The introduction of architecture principles, including segment abstraction, auto-discovery, and transport session to routing, was highlighted.  SRv6 is used as an example.  Feed back from the community was encouraged and the filename was changed to reflect the updated document.
*   **Computing-Aware Traffic Steering:** A presentation discussed integrating computing-aware traffic steering into the map architecture, leveraging anycast and metrics collected by a central controller. The motivation for adding anycast support to the map architecture was also explored.
*   **Mobile User Plane Evolution:** Kenji presented updates to the mobile user plane evolution draft, addressing comments from the adoption call. The focus is on the integration of gNB and UPF functions, with an argument to integrate with 6G roadmaps. Discussion on whether the work belongs in 3GPP or IETF ensued.
*   **Emergency Calling:** Discussion on enabling emergency calling on Wi-Fi-only devices, leveraging open roaming and pass point profiles. Focus was given on the need for network identification, service configuration, and signaling the access network location. The proposal involves leveraging existing IMS infrastructure and IETF protocols with minimal extensions.
*   **Mobile Traffic Steering:**  An overview was provided of an upcoming draft on mobile traffic steering, addressing the challenge of relocating mobility anchors mid-session and the need to steer traffic accordingly. Scope included various architectures and avoiding packet reordering. The first version (revision 03) of the draft is expected by end of month.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Authors of the slicing draft to present to TEAS working group.
*   **Action Item:** Consider sending a liaison statement to 3GPP (CT and SA5) regarding UDP source port slicing.
*   **Action Item:** Kenji to post text/feedback about the user plane evolution draft and if they agree with the resolution on the mailing list.
*   **Action Item:** Emergency calling proposal to contact SIPCORE chair to determine where to submit the work.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to continue refining their respective drafts based on the feedback received.
*   Working group to review the updated drafts on the mailing list.
*   The chair to determine next steps for drafts that are ready for adoption.
