<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 06 Nov 2023 12:00</p>
<h1>dmm</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The DMM meeting at IETF 118 covered working group status updates, discussion of existing drafts, and presentations on mobility-aware transport network slicing for 5G and computing-aware traffic steering for mobile user planes. A new proposal on SRH reduction for SRv6-based MAP was also presented. The focus was on the technical details of the drafts and their potential impact on existing protocols and architectures.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact Analysis from IPv6 DTPU Checksum Calculation:</strong> The chair requested feedback on the impact analysis document, particularly regarding the inclusion of current deployment status and impacts on UDP checksum.</li>
<li><strong>Anup Scope and CGP Liaison:</strong> Discussed comments from the working group last call on the Anup draft, particularly regarding its scope, convergence with CGP, and handling of mobility handover.</li>
<li><strong>Mobility-Aware Transport Network Slicing for 5G:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Clarification was provided on whether the slicing applies to the control plane, data plane, or both. The draft was updated to clarify it applies to connecting control plane functionalities.</li>
<li>Discussion around the applicability of transport engineering in the front haul network and the role of UPF.</li>
<li>The existence of PBR (Policy-Based Routing) in the draft was questioned, with the conclusion that references to the underlay should be minimized.</li>
<li>The use of UDP source port for sales and marketing and whether it can be implemented for slice and marketing.</li>
<li>Whether the method can be applied to control plane slices.</li>
<li>If Private networks are considered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Computing-Aware Traffic Steering for Mobile User Planes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Concerns were raised about potential conflicts with 3GPP procedures and the practicality of influencing compute based on 3GPP signals</li>
<li>Impact of the proposed architecture on the 5G control plane was discussed.</li>
<li>Questioned about how traffic engineer for any reason.</li>
<li>Interactions with 5GC and the complexity of the PDU session setup process.</li>
<li>Service Content Instance (SCI) optimization and its relevance to DMM.</li>
<li>Underlying network assumptions, specifically the reliance on SRv6.</li>
<li>Requested more details on advertisement</li>
<li>Relationships with SRv6 were discussed.</li>
<li>Using the any cost address as a service address</li>
<li>PD session created for multi services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SRH Reduction for SRv6-Based MAP:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A proposal for reducing SRH overhead in SRv6-based MAP by using a single SID to store both IPv6 address and GTP-U header information was presented.</li>
<li>Questioned if Separating the destination address is more efficient.</li>
<li>Concerns about the lack of standardization for Micro-SID.</li>
<li>Differentiation between SRv6 and IPv6 and security concerns.</li>
<li>compromise between the space and the processing.</li>
<li>Longer prefix fed and what protocol does it use to send it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anup Draft:</strong> Chairs will talk with the AD about the working group last call for the Anup draft.</li>
<li><strong>Mobility-Aware Transport Network Slicing for 5G:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Authors to review and remove PBR from the draft, focusing on the mapping between 3GPP and transport domains.</li>
<li>Authors to review if more details on maintaining entropy are needed and the suggestion of more feedback.</li>
<li>Authors need review from transport expert.</li>
<li>The author is to look at private networks for the draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Computing-Aware Traffic Steering for Mobile User Planes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Authors to consider comment questions about how traffic engineer for any reason.</li>
<li>Authors to consider 5GC in the next</li>
<li>Author needs to review if the document is in the series of cat's documents</li>
<li>Author needs to consider assumptions on the transport networks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SRH Reduction for SRv6-Based MAP:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Authors to consider suggestion about compromise between the space and the processing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to revise drafts based on feedback received during the meeting and on the mailing list.</li>
<li>Continue discussion on the mailing lists for the documents under consideration.</li>
<li>Further discussion on Anup pending chairs' discussion with the AD.</li>
</ul>
