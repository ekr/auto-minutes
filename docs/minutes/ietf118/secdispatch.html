<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 06 Nov 2023 14:30</p>
<h1>secdispatch</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The secdispatch session covered three topics: expected signed mail, on-network path validation, and a sub-DDoS architecture. The discussion on path validation raised concerns about the security benefits and appropriate venue for further work, resulting in a need for more discussion and a potential BAF. The presentation on signed mail focused on user experience challenges and potential solutions, with suggestions for lamps, a BAF, and consultation with the ART area. The sub-DDoS architecture presentation received feedback regarding deployment density and the need for clear use cases.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expected Signed Mail:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The core issue is the poor user experience and lack of clear benefit for end-to-end signing of email.</li>
<li>Discussion focused on signaling recipient expectations for signed mail.</li>
<li>There was a discussion regarding the relationship to email encryption, user experience, and protocol design.</li>
<li>Molestation of emails in transit was raised as a challenge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On-Network Path Validation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The presentation explored adding trustworthiness to routing paths.</li>
<li>The core gap is the need for a proof of transit mechanism to verify forwarding integrity.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about the applicability and potential security issues if trusted parties are not adjacent or if the &quot;transit&quot; proof is not complete.</li>
<li>Preventing spoofing was identified as a potential use case.</li>
<li>It was suggested that misconfiguration detection could be more valuable than security aspects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sub-DDoS Architecture:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The presentation explored a DDoS architecture leveraging source address validation techniques.</li>
<li>A key idea is the incremental deployment of sub-devices and sharing of spoofed source address information.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about the necessary density of deployed sub-devices and attack traffic in those networks for the approach to be effective.</li>
<li>The need for clear and realistic use cases was emphasized.</li>
<li>It was mentioned that any such system needed to be evaluated whether it constitutes unacceptable pervasive passive monitoring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-Network Path Validation:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Further discussion is needed before determining a suitable dispatch location. A BAF might be appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Presenters will hold a side meeting on Tuesday evening and share the outcome on the sec-dispatch mailing list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Expected Signed Mail:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> No immediate dispatch decision. Further consultation is needed with the ART area and potential liaison with the MOG.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Chairs will consult with ART and consider a BAF.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sub-DDoS Architecture:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> More discussion needed; no dispatch at this stage.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Presenters will propose a clearly defined use case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussions on the sec-dispatch mailing list.</li>
<li>Explore potential BAFs for both On-Network Path Validation and Expected Signed Mail.</li>
<li>Consult with relevant parties (ART, MOG) to determine the best path forward for the discussed topics.</li>
</ul>
