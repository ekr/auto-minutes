<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This meeting covered the status of several CBOR-related drafts, including EDN Literals, Update 8610 Grammar, Aktivo/CBOR Pack, and a DNS over CBOR format. The deterministic CBOR (DCBOR) effort was discussed, focusing on a common deterministic encoding profile. Decisions were made to extend the working group last call for EDN Literals and Update 8610 Grammar, and to start a call for adoption of the common deterministic encoding profile.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>EDN Literals and Update 8610 Grammar:</strong>  A working group last call was extended for one week to gather more feedback on both documents. There was a call for simplified feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Aktivo/CBOR Pack:</strong> Discussion revolved around reference tables, shared items, argument items, and function tags within the CBOR Pack specification. Table building was identified as a potentially application-specific area for innovation. The difficulties of using maps in combination with incremental table building were discussed.</li>
<li><strong>DNS over CBOR:</strong> The presentation covered a concise CBOR-based DNS message format, including omitting DNS fields for efficiency and utilizing name compression. Two name compression strategies were presented: component referencing and a lighter version of CBOR Pack. There was debate as to whether to use pack, or to use the implicit table structure that is already familiar.</li>
<li><strong>Deterministic CBOR (DCBOR):</strong> There are two documents relating to deterministic Cbor that need to be merged. One from Karsten, and one from Wolf. The discussion centered around the need for a common deterministic encoding profile for CBOR, specifically whether <code>2</code> should be treated the same as <code>2.0</code>. The group expressed support for adopting a common profile, with a decision on BCP versus Standards Track to be determined later.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Extend the working group last call for EDN Literals and Update 8610 Grammar for one week.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Start a call for adoption of the common deterministic encoding profile for CBOR on the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Karsten and Wolf to collaborate on merging their DCBOR documents into one.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Investigate the potential of adding a slicing reference to CBOR Pack.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Discuss the issue of query counts greater than 1 in DNS, as raised by Donald Eastlake, offline.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gather feedback on EDN Literals and Update 8610 Grammar during the extended working group last call.</li>
<li>Begin the call for adoption of the common deterministic encoding profile.</li>
<li>Karsten and Wolf to merge their documents on DCBOR.</li>
<li>Continued discussion and development of Aktivo/CBOR Pack, addressing outstanding merits and potential benchmarks.</li>
<li>Evaluate the two DNS/CBOR name compression approaches and make a decision on which direction to pursue.</li>
</ul>
