# Tutorial: New Participants' Overview

## Summary

This session provided an overview of the IETF for new participants, covering the organization's mission, structure, processes, and how to get involved. It also covered administrative details related to the current meeting and resources available to new participants.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IETF Mission:** To make the internet better by producing high-quality, relevant technical documents that influence the design, use, and management of the Internet. Success is measured by deployment and adoption of standards.
*   **IETF Structure:** The IETF comprises the IESG (Internet Engineering Steering Group), IRTF (Internet Research Task Force), IAB (Internet Architecture Board), and the Administrative LLC.  Key related entities are the RFC Editor and IANA.
*   **IETF Consensus Model:**  Decisions are made based on "rough consensus," where all issues are addressed, but not necessarily accommodated. Humming is used to gauge the strength of opinions.
*   **Joining Working Groups:**  Participants should review documents, join mailing lists, and contact the chair to contribute to existing work. The data tracker is a key resource.
*   **Starting New Work:** New work requires identifying a problem, proposing a solution, and finding collaborators.  Barboffs (informal gatherings) and dispatch sessions can help to initiate new work.
*   **Meeting Structure:** The IETF week includes working group sessions, research sessions (IRTF), tutorials, social events (when sponsored), hotter RFCs, and side meetings. The plenary session is important for administrative updates.
*   **Meeting Etiquette:** Attendees should be respectful, tolerant, and listen carefully. English is the official language, and the dress code is informal.
*   **Mead Echo:** The bespoke IETF tool is used for session attendance, queuing to ask questions, and remote participation.
*   **Data Tracker:** Datatracker.ietf.org is the primary resource for accessing working group information, documents, mailing list archives, and meeting materials.
*   **New Participant Activities:** Quick connections, new participant dinner, and a social hour are available for new participants to connect and get feedback.
*   **Available Support:** The secretariat, technical help desk, RFC editor, IANA desk, and Ombudsman's team are available for support. Area directors may hold office hours.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Add a short meet echo tutorial in a future meeting.

## Next Steps

*   New participants should subscribe to relevant mailing lists.
*   New participants should test the meet echo queue functionality.
*   Review the tutorial "How to Bring New Work to the IETF"
*   Attend the quick connections.
*   Attend the welcome reception and hot RFC sessions.
*   Stop by the registration desk and say hello to staff.
