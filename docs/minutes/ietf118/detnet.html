<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 06 Nov 2023 14:30</p>
<h1>detnet</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The first detnet session in Prague focused on the working group's status, charter updates, and integration of RAW (Reliable and Available Wireless) technologies into detnet. Discussions covered terminology, multi-domain scenarios, mobility, and edge computing integration. The session also addressed queuing mechanisms for enhanced data planes and the potential for leveraging existing TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking) queuing mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Charter Update:</strong> Acknowledged the integration of RAW and made explicit references to wireless support in the charter. Milestones were updated to reflect current work.</li>
<li><strong>Terminology:</strong> Discussed terminology convergence between detnet and RAW, including the use of &quot;recovery graph&quot; and the shift from &quot;PSC&quot; to &quot;PLR.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Layer Operations:</strong> Addressed concerns about layer violations in the RAW architecture, particularly regarding the interaction between layers for achieving parallel redundancy.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Domain detnet:</strong> Explored potential gaps and solutions for multi-domain detnet scenarios, emphasizing the need for inter-domain coordination and OEM mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Considered the requirements for supporting mobility in detnet, including control plane extensions for proactive movement preparation. Discussed whether mobility is within the scope of detnet or should be handled by Mobile IPv6.</li>
<li><strong>Edge Computing Integration:</strong> Examined how RAW could integrate with edge computing, particularly in the context of the MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Data Plane Queuing:</strong> Reviewed progress on initial evaluations of new proposed scheduling mechanisms and discussed the need for a taxonomy to classify these mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging TSN:</strong> Discussed whether detnet can use existing TSN queuing mechanisms and the problems with that.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Authors of working group documents with AD comments need to address those comments.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Carlos Bernardo to update drafts to align terminology with Pascal's proposed changes, namely, PLR instead of POC. Also to use `detnet e.g. raw network' to describe any raw network.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Working group to investigate benefits of mobility being solved at detnet or the existing Mobile IPv6 level.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Interested parties to develop a draft of the requirements for leveraging existing TSN queuing mechanisms with detnet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussions on the mailing list to address open issues.</li>
<li>Carlos Bernardo will produce a revision based on the group's comments.</li>
<li>Potential interim meeting to wrap up the RAW architecture document.</li>
<li>Further discussion on queuing mechanisms at the next session.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 08 Nov 2023 08:30</p>
<h1>detnet</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This detnet session covered updates on the requirements draft, as well as several individual contribution proposals focused on queuing mechanisms and use cases. Discussions centered on scalability, latency guarantees, traffic engineering, and the relationship between different queuing solutions. The session also included a discussion of potential interim meeting to discuss the raw architecture document.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Requirements Draft:</strong>  Updates were presented, including renaming sections and clarifying requirements related to bandwidth utilization, flow fluctuation, and scalability.  Discussion focused on criteria for evaluating scalable queuing mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>EDF Queuing:</strong> An Earliest Deadline First (EDF) based queuing mechanism was presented, aiming to improve scalability. Discussion centered on its applicability, particularly regarding different queuing options and competition with other solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Time Slot Queuing (TS):</strong> A TS queuing mechanism was proposed, designed to address scalability issues of existing Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) solutions. Concerns were raised about combining orchestration and hop-by-hop forwarding into a single draft.</li>
<li><strong>Cisco Queuing (CSCQF):</strong>  Updates on the CSCQF mechanism were presented, including time difference compensation and total reserved service rate estimation. Simulation results were shared.</li>
<li><strong>Time Gates and Cyclic Queuing:</strong> The concept of time gates for cyclic queuing was presented as a control plane solution for achieving high utilization and bounded latency. Discussion focused on the role of time gates and how they relate to interleaving flows.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Use Cases:</strong> New use cases beyond the existing RFC 8578 were presented, focusing on industrial applications, cloud AR/VR, cloud gaming, and live streaming. Discussion highlighted the need to include references in the document.</li>
<li><strong>Differentiated Data Queues:</strong> A presentation proposed differentiated data queues to support various deterministic services with different SLAs. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on the existing DetNet architecture. There was discussion of traffic engineering and the 3GPP's 5G system architecture as relevant parallels.</li>
<li><strong>Delay Compensation Mechanism:</strong>  A mechanism for delay compensation was introduced, calculating and adjusting for accumulated latency.  The discussion focused on implementation aspects and related control plane requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Requirements Draft:</strong> The document will be finalized according to discussions and prepared for a last call request.</li>
<li><strong>Queuing Solutions Open Meeting Series:</strong> The open meeting series will be leveraged to come to convergence on which queuing solutions should be selected by the working group, based on well-defined criteria.</li>
<li><strong>RAW Architecture Interim Meeting:</strong> If progress is not made on the mailing list regarding the RAW architecture document, an interim meeting will be scheduled, potentially the week of January 15th. Lou and Harvard are checking calendar possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>Taxonomy of Queuing Solutions:</strong> David will solicit help on a taxonomy for queuing solutions; a related meeting will be held in the second week of December. The specifics are forthcoming on the mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussion and contributions on the mailing list.</li>
<li>Prepare a last call request for the Requirements Draft.</li>
<li>Organize the Queuing Solutions Open Meeting Series to compare different queuing mechanisms against reference topologies.</li>
<li>Determine whether an interim meeting is needed for the RAW architecture document.</li>
<li>Review and incorporate feedback into individual contribution drafts.</li>
</ul>
