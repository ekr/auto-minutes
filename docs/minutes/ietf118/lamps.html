<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The LAMPS working group meeting covered a range of topics including updates on documents progressing through the IESG, discussion of KEM integration in CMS and CMP, and the AES CBC/GCM attack mitigation proposal. Several documents are nearing working group last call. A new draft regarding signaling of clear text copies in encrypted email messages was presented, and the working group will consider adoption.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>KEMRI Document (draft-ietf-lamps-cms-kemri):</strong> Currently in IESG state. External party raised concerns about inverse CBC decryption Oracle attack. Question raised about whether to include content encryption algorithm in CMS. Discussed CMS never doing HBKE.</li>
<li><strong>CMP DiscNet (draft-ietf-lamps-cmp-algorithms &amp; draft-ietf-lamps-cmp-updates):</strong> Incorporating RFC 9480 material as requested by the IESG. Need more review on KEM integration into CMP. Seeking feedback on content for KEM other info.</li>

<li><strong>End-to-End Mail Guidance (draft-richardson-lamps-e2e-mail-guidance):</strong> Discussed scenarios where a single message might be sent encrypted to some recipients and in clear text to others, and how mail user agents should handle this.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Note taker to initiate working group last call for the policy graph document (draft-ietf-lamps-cert-policy-data).</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Working group to consider adoption of the end-to-end mail guidance document (draft-richardson-lamps-e2e-mail-guidance).</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Note taker to initiate working group call for adoption for the end-to-end mail guidance document.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The LAMPS working group meeting covered a range of topics, including a new downgrade attack on CMS, potential mitigations for that attack, updates on existing drafts related to header protection and email guidance, composite KEMs and signatures, and a discussion of strategies for dealing with large public keys in certificates. Several drafts were discussed with calls for adoption initiated for some.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Downgrade Attack on CMS (Falco):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A new attack was presented that exploits CBC decryption within CMS when AAD modes are used, potentially allowing for the recovery of low-entropy blocks.</li>
<li>The attack works by crafting messages that, when processed by a vulnerable system, return garbled data that can be used to deduce information.</li>
<li>SMIME was initially investigated but the exploit is not as straightforward; focus shifted to the broader CMS context.</li>
<li>A key separation mitigation was proposed to bind encryption algorithms to specific keys.</li>
<li>The attack impacts CCA2 security of AAD modes due to CBC decryption allowing modified messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mitigation via KDF (Scott):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed a solution involving a Key Derivation Function (KDF) applied to the CEK (Content Encryption Key), incorporating the algorithm identifier.</li>
<li>This KDF would be triggered by a new OID in the unprotected attributes of CMS structures.</li>
<li>Removing the OID would deny the attacker access to the content, mitigating the attack, but may cause a denial of service.</li>
<li>The generated CEK must be dependent on the mode used.</li>
<li>Suggested the inclusion of context-specific salt for CMS within the HKDF to prevent cross-protocol attacks, or, maybe do not include.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>End-to-End Mail Guidance and Header Protection (DKG):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updates were provided on both drafts, with only minor changes since the last IETF meeting, after working group last call.</li>
<li>A request was made to advance both documents out of working group last call.</li>
<li>Discussion on external resources in end-to-end email.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Composite KEMs (Antonio):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Draft updates included a formal definition of generating encapsulation and decapsulation, pseudo code, and reworked wire formats to remove generics in ASN.1.</li>
<li>Changes from sequence of subject public key info to sequence of bit string in ASN.1 structure, which is now Composite KEM PublicKey rather than Composite PublicKey.</li>
<li>Removed a dependency on KEMs by lifting the text into KEMs and SIGs</li>
<li>Discussion about how to handle combinations of KDF primitives, including the use of KDF3 with SHA3. Discussion on the security considerations of combining key sizes, security levels, symmetric primitives.</li>
<li>DHKEM dependency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Revocation Available (Toma):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation covered a draft specifying a &quot;no revocation available&quot; certificate extension for short-lived certificates.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about how OCSP responders should treat certificates with this extension and use cases like device certificates.</li>
<li>Should use valid response in OCSP.</li>
<li>Considerations around the validity period of this type of certificate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CMC Bis (Sean):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Draft updates focused on removing SHA-1 as the default and updating algorithms in line with current best practices.</li>
<li>The working group looked at a revision of CMS Best.</li>
<li>Discussion on appropriate default algorithms to transition to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SHA3 CMS Individual Draft (Russ):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Draft exists to publish OIDs for Shaw 3, but whether it would be used in conjunction with the composite draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash Based Signatures (Max):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updates covered addressing previous comments.</li>
<li>Discussion about use cases, specifically code signing for manufacturers and use of hash-based signatures at the root level, and, therefore, alignment to related documents is important.</li>
<li>Discussion about whether to split the document into different documents.</li>
<li>Open issue on dealing with Stateful signatures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Composite Signatures (Kevin):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rework of the wire format.</li>
<li>Remove all signatures that has confidence at signature parameters. The OID now fully specifies the component algorithms.</li>
<li>Add NLDSA 44 combinations</li>
<li>Discussion about hash of Durham coded OID or hash of full algorithm ID or using hash of the full composite key, related to property requirements/functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>External Public Keys (David):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion on public keys in certificates that are extremely large. Instead of putting in certificate, use a URL and a hash of the public key in the certificate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>KDF Mitigation:</strong> Scott will write an internet draft for the proposed KDF-based mitigation.</li>
<li><strong>End-to-End Mail Guidance and Header Protection:</strong> Chairs to follow up on list to move document to ISG.</li>
<li><strong>No Revocation Available:</strong> Chair to start a call for adoption on mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>CMC Bis:</strong> Remain as current, to allow updates.</li>
<li><strong>Hash Based Signatures:</strong> Chair to start a call for adoption on mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Composite Signatures:</strong> After changes, move to a call for adoption.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to continue work on the respective drafts, addressing feedback from the working group.</li>
<li>Working group to review the drafts and provide additional feedback on the mailing lists.</li>
<li>Chairs to initiate calls for adoption for the &quot;No Revocation Available,&quot; &quot;Hash Based Signatures,&quot; and &quot;Composite Signatures&quot; drafts.</li>
