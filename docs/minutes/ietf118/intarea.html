<h1>intarea</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This intarea meeting covered several topics including updates on working group items, proxy configurations in provisioning domains, trusted domain SRV6, revisiting the use of IP stacks, and identification extensions for the internet protocol. Discussions ranged from protocol number assignments to security considerations in SRV6 and performance implications of IP fragmentation. Several drafts were presented and requests for adoption were made.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protocol Numbers for Sheik:</strong> Decision made to move the draft handling protocol numbers for the Sheik protocol from the intarea working group to the newly formed Sheik working group, with cross-working group last call with intarea.</li>
<li><strong>Proxy Configurations in Provisioning Domains:</strong> Tommy Poly presented an update on the draft. Discussion points included handling duplicate or overlapping domain name spaces, distinguishing between different types of UDP proxies, and leveraging existing knowledge from WPAD.</li>
<li><strong>Trusted Domain SRV6:</strong> Andrew presented an update, requesting an adoption call. Concerns were raised about operational burden, the necessity of a new ether type, and dependency on the Spring security considerations draft.</li>
<li><strong>Reversed Tracert:</strong> Valentyn presented a draft for reverse traceroute using ICMP. Key discussion points revolved around the stateful nature of the proposed solution and the potential for using UDP instead of ICMP. Recommendations were made to present the draft to the IPPM or OPSAWG working groups.</li>
<li><strong>IP Stack in Deep Space:</strong> Mark Lanche presented the draft about IP use in deep space. Concerns about ignoring the DTM architecture and better understanding about what it takes to move beats from planet a to planet b. Timers and protocols were discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Identification Extensions for the Internet Protocol:</strong> Fred presented a draft focusing on longer IP IDs and fragmentation reassembly feedback for performance maximization. Concerns were raised about the reliability of fragmentation and the potential impact on overall performance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Move the &quot;Protocol Numbers for Sheik&quot; draft to the Sheik working group.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Authors of &quot;Trusted Domain SRV6&quot; draft to consider feedback and continue discussion on the mailing list. Consider waiting for Spring draft to progress.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Authors of &quot;Reversed Tracert&quot; draft to present the draft to the IPPM or OPSAWG working groups.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Author of &quot;IP Stack in Deep Space&quot; draft to acknowledge that more work needs to be done.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussion on the mailing lists for each draft.</li>
<li>Consider adoption calls for drafts where requested, contingent on further review and feedback.</li>
<li>Further develop drafts based on the input received during the meeting.</li>
</ul>
