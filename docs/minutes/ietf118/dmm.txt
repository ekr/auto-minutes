## Summary

The DMM meeting at IETF 118 covered working group status updates, discussion of existing drafts, and presentations on mobility-aware transport network slicing for 5G and computing-aware traffic steering for mobile user planes. A new proposal on SRH reduction for SRv6-based MAP was also presented. The focus was on the technical details of the drafts and their potential impact on existing protocols and architectures.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Impact Analysis from IPv6 DTPU Checksum Calculation:** The chair requested feedback on the impact analysis document, particularly regarding the inclusion of current deployment status and impacts on UDP checksum.
*   **Anup Scope and CGP Liaison:** Discussed comments from the working group last call on the Anup draft, particularly regarding its scope, convergence with CGP, and handling of mobility handover.
*   **Mobility-Aware Transport Network Slicing for 5G:**
    *   Clarification was provided on whether the slicing applies to the control plane, data plane, or both. The draft was updated to clarify it applies to connecting control plane functionalities.
    *   Discussion around the applicability of transport engineering in the front haul network and the role of UPF.
    *   The existence of PBR (Policy-Based Routing) in the draft was questioned, with the conclusion that references to the underlay should be minimized.
    *   The use of UDP source port for sales and marketing and whether it can be implemented for slice and marketing.
    *   Whether the method can be applied to control plane slices.
    *   If Private networks are considered.
*   **Computing-Aware Traffic Steering for Mobile User Planes:**
    *   Concerns were raised about potential conflicts with 3GPP procedures and the practicality of influencing compute based on 3GPP signals
    *   Impact of the proposed architecture on the 5G control plane was discussed.
    *   Questioned about how traffic engineer for any reason.
    *   Interactions with 5GC and the complexity of the PDU session setup process.
    *   Service Content Instance (SCI) optimization and its relevance to DMM.
    *   Underlying network assumptions, specifically the reliance on SRv6.
    *   Requested more details on advertisement
    *   Relationships with SRv6 were discussed.
    *   Using the any cost address as a service address
    *   PD session created for multi services.
*   **SRH Reduction for SRv6-Based MAP:**
    *   A proposal for reducing SRH overhead in SRv6-based MAP by using a single SID to store both IPv6 address and GTP-U header information was presented.
    *   Questioned if Separating the destination address is more efficient.
    *   Concerns about the lack of standardization for Micro-SID.
    *   Differentiation between SRv6 and IPv6 and security concerns.
    *   compromise between the space and the processing.
    *   Longer prefix fed and what protocol does it use to send it?

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Anup Draft:** Chairs will talk with the AD about the working group last call for the Anup draft.
*   **Mobility-Aware Transport Network Slicing for 5G:**
    *   Authors to review and remove PBR from the draft, focusing on the mapping between 3GPP and transport domains.
    *   Authors to review if more details on maintaining entropy are needed and the suggestion of more feedback.
    *   Authors need review from transport expert.
    *   The author is to look at private networks for the draft.
*   **Computing-Aware Traffic Steering for Mobile User Planes:**
    *   Authors to consider comment questions about how traffic engineer for any reason.
    *   Authors to consider 5GC in the next
    *   Author needs to review if the document is in the series of cat's documents
    *   Author needs to consider assumptions on the transport networks.
*   **SRH Reduction for SRv6-Based MAP:**
    *   Authors to consider suggestion about compromise between the space and the processing.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to revise drafts based on feedback received during the meeting and on the mailing list.
*   Continue discussion on the mailing lists for the documents under consideration.
*   Further discussion on Anup pending chairs' discussion with the AD.
