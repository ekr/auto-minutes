## Summary

The netmod meeting at IETF 118 covered several topics, including updates on existing drafts, discussions on YANG versioning, system defined configuration, and new proposals for data modeling. Key discussions revolved around YANG versioning strategies, the need for an immutable flag for system configurations, and a new proposal for accessing data from remote data sources.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Interface Extension YANG and Sub Interface VLAN YANG:** Scott Mansfield provided updates on these drafts, seeking support for moving them forward. A key issue was identified in the Sub Interface VLAN YANG draft related to a defunct reference.
*   **System Defined Configuration:** Updates were presented, including the definition of a NETCONF capability identifier and considerations for client usage. Open issues regarding the line validation of running-along configurations and the origin value for system nodes were discussed. An interim meeting was proposed to address these issues.
*   **Extensions to Contradiction Model:** Oscar presented updates on the extensions to the ACL model. A poll was conducted to gauge working group preference for augmentation vs. a base module update.
*   **YANG Versioning:** A detailed discussion covered several aspects of YANG versioning, including file name changes, recommended minimum versions, versioning of instance data, and the handling of whitespace changes. Consensus was sought on various proposals related to versioning semantics and implementation details.
*   **Immutable Flag:** Concerns were raised about the removal of the immutable extension, particularly by 3GPP delegates. Discussions focused on the stability and purpose of immutable flags, including their relationship to system defined configuration.
*   **Remote Data Source Access:** Alex presented a new proposal for modeling YANG-defined information from remote data sources. The presentation sparked questions about the naming of "mount points", handling of absolute leaf refs, and must statements. The discussion also covered the differences with Scheme-mount and the usefulness of "data visualization" as an alternative term.
*   **Interface Franks Module:** Scott Mansfield is looking for a home for a draft in CCAMP.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Interface Extension YANG and Sub Interface VLAN YANG:** Resolve the open question regarding the defunct reference in the Sub Interface VLAN YANG draft quickly and aim to last call both drafts simultaneously.
*   **System Defined Configuration:** Hold an interim meeting to discuss the open issues of line validation and the origin value in system nodes.
*   **Extensions to Contradiction Model:** Discuss the best approach (augmentation vs. biz) offline after this meeting.
*   **YANG Versioning:** Further discussion on all questions is encouraged in weekly design team meetings.
*   **Remote Data Source Access:** Discuss on the list.
*   **Immutable Flag:** The working group needs to see what the solutions are and line up.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to resolve open issues in their respective drafts based on the meeting discussions.
*   Schedule an interim meeting for System Defined Configuration.
*   Continue discussions on YANG versioning and other topics on the mailing list and in the weekly design team meetings.
*   Chair to find a permanent home for Interface Franks Module.
