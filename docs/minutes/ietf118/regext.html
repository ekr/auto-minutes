<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 09 Nov 2023 14:00</p>
<h1>regext</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The regext working group met to discuss several ongoing and potential new work items related to EPP and RDEB. Key topics included TTL extensions, RUR search, contact management, handling of object deletions, variant TLDs, geofeed data in RDEB, and the possibility of a RESTful transport for EPP. The group actively sought feedback on various proposals and discussed the best path forward for several documents.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TTL Extension (Gavin Brown):</strong> Presentation of proposed changes to the EPP extension for specifying TTL values, aiming for a simpler XML syntax while balancing complexity between client and server implementations.  Concerns about the lack of DNS expertise was raised.</li>
<li><strong>RUR Search (Tom Harrison):</strong> Update on the RUR search extension for internet number resource types, focusing on clarifying examples for arbitrary range searches and addressing the use of extension identifiers in path segments. The working group needs to provide input on whether a more standards-compliant approach is needed.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Management (Andy Newton, Jim Reed):</strong> Extensive discussion regarding the future of contact representations in EPP and RDEB. Concerns were raised about the current JS contact proposal and its complexity, as well as the potential for fragmentation if multiple standards are pursued.</li>
<li><strong>Object Deletions (Scott Hollenbeck):</strong> Presentation of a draft document outlining potential hijacking risks related to deletion of host and domain objects, and seeking community input on best practices.  The working group noted it might be best addressed by changes to EPP.</li>
<li><strong>Variant TLDs (Gavin Brown):</strong> Overview of developments in ICANN related to variant TLDs and the potential impact on provisioning, highlighting the need for early engagement from engineers to ensure feasible solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Geofeed Data in RDEB (Jess Dipp):</strong> Request for adoption of an RDEB extension for geofeed data, providing a structured way to access IP geolocation information.</li>
<li><strong>RESTful Transport for EPP (Martin Bjorklund):</strong>  Proposal to explore a RESTful transport for EPP to address issues with load balancing, access management, and developer experience. There's strong support to explore RESTful transport while the impact of introducing JSON should be done with caution.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TTL Extension:</strong> Gavin Brown will move forward with the new syntax for the TTL extension and publish it next week. He will take the group up on the offer to engage the DNS Directorate for review.</li>
<li><strong>RUR Search:</strong>  The working group needs to discuss the extension identifier issue on the mailing list to determine if a more standards-compliant approach should be adopted.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Management:</strong> It was determined that both JS contact and simple contact will be experimental or informational. Community discussion needs to take place on the mailing list to determine which, and how to move forward to refine documents.</li>
<li><strong>Object Deletions:</strong> Scott Hollenbeck will bring presentation into the Software and group. The current practice of using of a sacrificial TLD should note the dot invalid domain name.</li>
<li><strong>Geofeed Data in RDEB:</strong> Jess Dipp will send a message to the chairs to formally request adoption of the RDEB extension for geofeed data.</li>
<li><strong>RESTful Transport for EPP (Martin Bjorklund):</strong> Formally adopt a work item, and create a new document for RESTful transport</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Discuss the use of extension identifiers in RUR search on the mailing list.</li>
<li>Engage in further discussions on the mailing list regarding the future direction of JS contact and simple contact proposals.</li>
<li>Scott Hollenbeck will bring the object deletion practices into the Software and group.</li>
<li>Martin Bjorklund will formally adopt a work item, and create a new document for RESTful transport.</li>
<li>Attendees are encouraged to provide topics for the next meeting to allow for a wider time slot.</li>
