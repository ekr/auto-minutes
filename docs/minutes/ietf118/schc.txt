# schc

## Summary
The SCHC working group meeting covered several key topics, including updates on existing drafts (AUM, RFC 8824 update, Access Control) and discussions around new areas such as flow compression and zero-energy devices. The meeting also included a discussion about updating the SCHC architecture draft.  Adoption calls were held for the RFC 8824 update and the Access Control drafts, with positive sentiment expressed for both, pending confirmation on the mailing list.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **AUM (ICMPv6 Compression):**  Discussed dividing the draft into two parts: general ICMPv6 compression and optimizations for constrained networks (LPWAN).  Explored using a global action mechanism to proxy pings and generate ICMP error messages.
*   **RFC 8824 Update (CoAP Compression):**  The draft is being rewritten to obsolete RFC 8824, consolidating clarifications, additions, and updates into a single base document. Discussed including updates for CoAP options introduced after RFC 8824.
*   **SCHC Access Control:** Proposed modifying field descriptors to allow for dynamic updates of target values for specific protocols like CoAP, in order to reduce the number of rules needed for compression. Presented tables outlining access control for different CoAP extension field IDs.
*   **SCHC Flow Compression:** Presented a new work item focusing on compressing headers of flows (TCP, UDP, etc.).  Discussed using access control for target value updates, a YANG data model for management, and actions to create derivable rules with reference values.
*   **Zero-Energy Devices:**  Introduced a draft focusing on zero-energy devices, their characteristics, and potential applications of SCHC.  Discussed different device types (backscatter, energy storage), topologies, and challenges related to power constraints and unreliable connectivity. Discussed the need for standardization in 3GPP. Also addressed platformization and potential use of SCHC as a transport protocol.
*   **SCHC Architecture:** Outlined the goal of defining a generic, layered architecture applicable to both IP and non-IP protocols. Introduced the concept of discriminators and a new rule nature for management.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **IP Protocol Number Draft:**  The IP protocol number draft should be moved from the INT area back to the SCHC working group. Authors need to submit a new version changing the draft name to include "schc" and indicate replacement of the previous document.  A dual-track working group last call is needed in both SCHC and INT.
*   **RFC 8824 Update (CoAP Compression):** Adopted as a working group item, pending confirmation on the mailing list.
*   **SCHC Access Control:** Possible adoption as a working group item, pending confirmation on the mailing list. Further work to develop access control for IP and UDP to match that already defined in 8724/8824.
*   **Authors:** Tell the authors to rename the draft

## Next Steps
*   **Mailing List Discussions:**  Confirm adoption of the RFC 8824 update and SCHC Access Control drafts on the mailing list. Discuss what content from the Access Control draft should be put in the architecture draft.
*   **SCHC Architecture Draft:** Update the SCHC architecture draft to reflect discussions on discriminators, management rules, and zero-energy device use cases.
*   **Flow Compression:** Develop examples for the next presentation and get some inputs on use cases.
*   **Zero-Energy Devices:** Continue developing the draft and explore its relationship with existing SCHC mechanisms (header, actions).
*   **Interim Meeting:** Schedule a next interim meeting.
