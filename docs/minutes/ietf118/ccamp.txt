## Summary

The CCAMP working group meeting covered a packed agenda with presentations and discussions on various draft documents. Key topics included optical impairment aware topology, WDM tunnel modeling, microwave topology, ACTN enhancements, and coherent pluggable management. The meeting aimed to progress existing drafts towards last call and identify future work items.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Optical Impairment Aware Topology Model:** Updates included addressing vendor operational modes, dynamic gain equalization, and muxponder constraints. Open issues regarding DG modeling are being addressed.
*   **LSP S1993bis:** Focused on aligning with optical impairments, fixing YANG doctor last call comments, and updating flexible grid channel spacing definitions.
*   **WDM Tunnel Modeling:** Discussions centered on merging WDM and FlexGrid tunnel models into a single unified model. Updates included adding a combined label structure and allowing client-specified constraints.
*   **Microwave Topology:** Several modules originally in the microwave topology draft are being considered for relocation to other working groups (Teas, NetMod, Ivy). Discussed bandwidth availability topology and interface topology.
*   **ASON/GMPLS Control in the SDN Era:** Updates included user labels, node/LTP by topology, PM state extensions, and alarm thresholds. Discussions revolved around the architecture of ASON service and tunnel models, and service-level path computation.
*   **Data Model for Optical Resource Performance Monitoring:** Covered functionality for legacy interfaces and the need for alignment between IETF and ITU-T models. Proposed working group adoption.
*   **ACTN Functionality for the Gray Area Network:** Focused on enhancing ACTN with finer-grained management capabilities and incorporating traditional OSS/NMS interfaces. Discussions explored security and the applicability beyond optical domains.
*   **PCEP extensions for Transponder Mode Specification:** Presented a proposal to carry transceiver mode information in RSVP signaling, aligning with the optical impairment YANG module.
*   **ACTN for Coherent Pluggable Management:** Detailed use cases and requirements for managing coherent pluggables in IP routers within an ACTN framework. Emphasized end-to-end visibility, alarm correlation, and service provisioning. Discussed different control options (hierarchical vs. direct).

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **WDM Tunnel Modeling Draft:** Resubmit as draft-ietf-ccamp with replacement of existing drafts marked in the header.
*   **Bandwidth Availability Topology Draft:** Present in Teas to determine fit. If not accepted, consider NetMod.
*   **Interface Topology Draft:** Continue to look for the right working group and present it to Ivy for consideration.
*   **Microwave Radio Link Draft:** Proceed with adoption process after advertising on the mailing list.
*   **Microwave Topology Draft:** Prepare for YANG doctor review and then progress toward last call.
*   **Optical Impairment Aware Topology Model & LSP S1993bis:** Resolve open issues and coordinate route indirect review to move them forward as a cluster.
*   **ACTN for Coherent Pluggable Management:** Focus on a single NBI (NE).
*   **ACTN for Coherent Pluggable Management & Pluggables in an ACTN Framework:** There will be liaising between working groups on the topics of security and overall views. Combine documents, to have umbrella. The Chair has action to take the inputs from all documents.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address open issues and feedback received during the meeting.
*   Chairs to facilitate working group adoption calls for relevant drafts.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list to resolve outstanding questions and plan future work.
