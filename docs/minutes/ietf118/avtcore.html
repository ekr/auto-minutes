<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 08 Nov 2023 08:30</p>
<h1>avtcore</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The AVTcore working group met at IETF 118 to discuss the status of various drafts and adopted proposals related to audio and video transport. Key topics included errata verification, updates to RTP payload formats (JPEG 2000, stipend, RTP over QUIC, HEVC profile for WebRTC, V3C, SFrame, geometry-based point cloud compression, haptics), and working group last call progress. Several actions were assigned to authors and chairs for further document revisions and adoption calls.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Errata Verification:</strong> Three errata were reviewed. EID 4873 was verified; EID 4938 was put on hold for document updates; and EID 6752 was verified.</li>
<li><strong>RTP Payload Type Registry:</strong> The group discussed the issue of missing video codecs in the RTP payload type registry. Magnus volunteered to write a short document closing the RTP registry and updating RFC 4855 and RFC 8888.</li>
<li><strong>JPEG 2000 RTP Payload Format:</strong> The proposed payload format improves upon the existing format. A new Internet draft is expected to address two issues identified during the last WG call.</li>
<li><strong>RTP Payload Format for Stipend:</strong> The draft is stalled at the ICSG. Discussions focused on clarification of RTP packetization, the interaction of skip with multiplexing, SRTP usage, and feedback mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>RTP over QUIC:</strong> Updated to address congestion control and IANA considerations. Closed several issues, including &quot;won't fix&quot; resolutions. Several open issues were discussed, including congestion control when sharing a quick connection and the use of real-time congestion controllers.</li>
<li><strong>HEVC Profile for WebRTC:</strong> Implementation updates in Chromium and Safari are progressing. TX mode, packet handling, and RPSI were discussed with proposed resolutions.</li>
<li><strong>V3C:</strong> The working group last call has been issued.</li>
<li><strong>SFrame:</strong> Discussions addressed hop-by-hop negotiation of payload types and header extensions.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Volumetric Media:</strong> The draft is aligned with specifications and has incorporated feedback from previous meetings.</li>
<li><strong>Haptics:</strong> The group discussed the haptic streaming format and associated parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Geometry-Based Point Cloud Compression:</strong> An early draft was presented, outlining a payload format for geometry-based point cloud compression.</li>
<li><strong>Adoption Calls:</strong> The working group determined the readiness of several drafts for adoption calls.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Murray to update errata to verify EID 4873 and EID 6752, and hold EID 4938.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Magnus to write a short document closing the RTP registry and updating RFC 4855 and RFC 8888.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> JPEG 2000 author to submit a new ID with the new working group name</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Bernard to follow-up with Stipend authors on ISG comments, security and profile considerations.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> V3C chairs to select a document shepherd (Stephane volunteered).</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Visual Volumetric authors to work with the chairs to submit adoption call.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Haptics authors to submit new revision for WG adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Bernard to summarize WG last call for V3C</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Address open issues for various drafts.</li>
<li>Authors to revise and resubmit drafts based on meeting discussions.</li>
<li>Chairs to schedule interim meeting for continued progress.</li>
<li>Working group adoption call on visual volumetric draft.</li>
</ul>
