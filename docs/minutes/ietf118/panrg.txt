## Summary

This session of the panrg meeting focused primarily on the SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation on Next-Generation Networks) architecture.  Presentations covered an API for retrieving energy consumption data from the network, the SCION control and data planes, operational aspects of SCION deployments, and a specific use case within the Swiss financial industry. The session concluded with a discussion on the future direction of SCION-related work within the IETF/IRTF, exploring options for standardization and further research.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Energy API:**
    *   Presentation on an API for retrieving energy consumption information from network paths, considering both baseline and traffic-dependent energy usage.
    *   Discussion about including energy source information in the API and aligning with carbon-aware networking initiatives.
*   **SCION Architecture:**
    *   Overview of SCION's control plane (beaconing, registration, resolution), data plane (hop-by-hop forwarding based on header information), and PKI (trust model).
    *   Discussion of security considerations, including path hijacking prevention and inter-domain authentication.
*   **SCION Deployments and Operations:**
    *   Explanation of the SCION Internet ecosystem, including backbones, isolation domains, and edge gateways.
    *   Details on bootstrapping new isolation domains, acquiring AS numbers and certificates, and setting up peering relationships.
    *   Description of IP-in-SCION tunneling as a common deployment model.
    *   Use case examples in Swiss finance and healthcare, highlighting benefits like high availability, resilience, and controlled governance.
*   **SCION Standardization and Research:**
    *   Call for standardization to foster ecosystem growth, interoperability, and broader adoption.
    *   Discussion of open research questions, including interoperability, transition mechanisms, naming, and operational aspects.
    *   Exploration of potential synergies with other technologies like LISP and RPKI.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **SCION Drafts:** Consider adoption of the three core SCION drafts as implementation drafts within the PanRG.
*   **Mailing List Discussion:** The chairs will initiate a discussion on the panrg mailing list to formally propose adoption of the SCION implementation drafts.
*   **Future Meetings:**  Chairs will consider scheduling subsequent panrg meetings with more SCION-related content, particularly at IETF 118 in Brisbane.

## Next Steps

*   Chairs to phrase the adoption proposal and post it to the panrg mailing list.
*   Community to discuss the proposal and express interest.
*   Continue conversations with IETF area directors regarding next steps for SCION standardization.
