# 6lo

## Summary
The 6lo working group meeting covered several topics including updates on existing drafts, applicability of IPv6 over short range optical wireless communication, and a proposal for a generic address assignment option. Discussions focused on clarifying protocol stack usage, addressing duplicate address detection, and determining the best path forward for address assignment options.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IPv6 and Prefix Registration:** Discussion on the draft that allows a host to claim a prefix to the router, and the desire for a mechanism for the host to prove ownership of the prefix.
*   **Transmission of SCHC Compressed Packets over 802.15.4 Networks:** Clarification of protocol stack options, the use of single-hop communication, and modifications to routing approaches (straightforward, tunneled, pointer-based). The need for guidelines on when to use each of these solutions was discussed.
*   **Path Aware Semantic Addressing for LLNs:** Updates to the base document were presented. Concerns about multicast and privacy were addressed. Need to address duplicate address detection in the document.
*   **Generic Address Assignment Option for 6LoWPAN:** Discussed the addition of a generic address assignment option and explored the idea of making Pasa a use case of a more general mechanism.
*   **Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Short Range Optical Wireless Communication:** Discussed addressing, neighbor discovery, header compression and fragmentation, and multicast. A question was raised about whether the protocol works if the link layer is unidirectional.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IPv6 and Prefix Registration:** Pascal will update the draft with the new flow and the working group will provide feedback.
*   **Transmission of SCHC Compressed Packets over 802.15.4 Networks:** Align the draft with the chic working group architecture draft. Provide details on rule ID management. Complete examples in appendix a.
*   **Path Aware Semantic Addressing for LLNs:**  The working group will review the updated draft.  The document should clearly state that address duplicates are not possible.
*   **Generic Address Assignment Option for 6LoWPAN:**  Decide whether to move forward with the generic address assignment option (GAO) as a separate document or merge it with Pasa. If GAO moves forward, revise the document. If not, wrap up Pasa.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to incorporate feedback received during the meeting into draft revisions.
*   Working group members to review updated drafts and provide feedback on the mailing list.
*   Decision on GAO will determine the path forward for Pasa.
