<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 07 Nov 2023 12:00</p>
<h1>wimse</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; (BoF) session explored the potential for IETF work on workload identity in multi-tenant environments (WIMSE).  The session included presentations on use cases, existing technologies like SPIFFE, and proposed solutions. A key focus was on identifying gaps in current standards and exploring potential new work items.  The discussion highlighted the need for a well-defined scope to prevent the BoF from becoming an unfocused collection of disparate ideas. The group took a poll about interest in the topic and contributing to the draft. There was not a clear consensus as to whether this effort should be AR or SEC area.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Challenge:</strong>  Customers struggle to manage workload identities and implement zero-trust architectures across multiple cloud and service environments due to a lack of standardized identity systems.</li>
<li><strong>Leveraging Existing Standards:</strong>  While many relevant standards and community projects (SPIFFE, MTLS, OAuth, OpenID Connect, RATS, Cedar) exist, gaps remain in connecting these ecosystems for workload identity.</li>
<li><strong>Request Binding:</strong>  Challenges exist in securely retaining the original identity as requests are passed between workloads within a compute environment. Existing mechanisms like Depop do not fully cover the relevant threat model.</li>
<li><strong>Workload Definition:</strong> Clear discussion that a workload is a specific piece of software fulfilling a particular purpose and may involve multiple copies of the same software.</li>
<li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Various use cases were presented including constrained credential security, cross-workload access, chain of custody of requests, localized authentication and authorization decisions, disconnected audit logs, and general requirements around observability and manageability.</li>
<li><strong>SPIFFE:</strong> SPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone) is a workload identity specification living in the CNCF, widely adopted for workload-to-workload authentication and identity. It does not however create new token types.</li>
<li><strong>Container Technologies:</strong> Container technologies like Kubernetes and Docker employ specific mechanisms (e.g., &quot;service account volume projection&quot;) for workload identity. Standardizing the usage and configuration of these mechanisms could improve interoperability.</li>
<li><strong>Token Containers:</strong> A token container approach, treating the request as a graph rather than a linear flow, was proposed to accommodate multiple statements from different systems along the request path.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency Services:</strong> Transparency logs, which are often found in supply chain contexts, can be used to further improve the security of nested token flows.</li>
<li><strong>Charter Scope:</strong> Concern was raised that the proposed charter was too open-ended, potentially attracting irrelevant or previously rejected work. It was proposed that the charter be more tightly focused on specific initial work items.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Refine the charter to have a much more limited scope and list the specific deliverables, rather than being generally focused on all workload identity.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Prioritize initial efforts on documenting existing architectures and developing best practices using existing technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Revisit the need for new standards work based on identified gaps, after a period of analysis and documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussions on the mailing list to refine the charter scope and initial work items.</li>
<li>Clarify the proposed architecture document's objective, focusing on documenting current deployment practices of technologies like Kubernetes and Docker.</li>
<li>Consider whether the initial focus should be on existing protocols vs. developing new mechanisms, which will help guide what IETF area is the most relevant.</li>
</ul>
