## Summary
The LSVR working group meeting focused on the status of existing drafts, including the BGP-LS specification, YANG model, and updates to NRI election rules. A key discussion point was the re-chartering of the working group and its future direction. Several proposed updates and extensions to the BGP-LS protocol were presented, particularly regarding its application in multi-segment SD-WAN scenarios.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **BGP-LS Draft Status:** The authors are working on changes based on the shepherd review, aiming for a new working group last call after incorporating feedback.
*   **BGP-LS YANG Model:** Updates include support for BGP-LS attributes, with ongoing work to improve the representation of nested TLVs. Discussion revolved around leveraging existing IGP models for inspiration.
*   **Multi-Segment SD-WAN with BGP-LS:** Proposed extensions to BGP-LS to support SD-WAN use cases, including the advertisement of link types and consideration of link quality requirements. There was a suggestion to consider using affinity/link colors instead of introducing a new TLV for link type.
*   **BGP-LS NRI Election Rules:** Proposed updates to address convergence delays, redundant advertisements, and non-deterministic selection. The discussion focused on whether these updates should be incorporated into the base specification or maintained in a separate document.
*   **Working Group Re-chartering:** Discussion on the future direction of the working group, considering new application spaces and the level of active participation. Key topics included potential extensions for L3DoS, protocol maintenance, and BGP-LS applications. There was agreement that the chairs should create and circulate a draft charter amendment.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Action Item:** Authors of the BGP-LS draft to incorporate feedback from the shepherd review and prepare for a new working group last call.
*   **Action Item:** Authors of the BGP-LS YANG model to investigate the OSPF model's handling of TLVs and sub-TLVs for potential adoption in the BGP-LS model.
*   **Decision:**  Updates to BGP-LS NRI election rules should be maintained in a separate document, rather than being merged into the base specification at this time.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs to create and circulate a draft amended working group charter for review and feedback, focusing initially on protocol maintenance and extensions like L3DoS.

## Next Steps
*   The chairs will solicit feedback on the list.
*   A draft revised charter will be posted and reviewed, targeting completion before the end of the year.
*   Authors will work on updating the relevant drafts based on meeting discussions.
