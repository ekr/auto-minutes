# v6ops

## Summary

This v6ops meeting covered several important topics, including updates on documentation prefixes, transitioning technologies, happy eyeballs algorithm, the scalability of IPv6 NAT64 implementations, prefix allocation on home gateways, network extensions for hosts, and real-world IPv6-only deployments in enterprise networks.  Discussions touched on the evolving landscape of IPv6 deployment, challenges, and potential solutions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Documentation Prefix Size (RFC 3849 update):**
    *   Discussion on the need to increase the size of the IPv6 documentation prefix.
    *   Original /32 is now insufficient for representing modern network deployments.
    *   Proposal to use a /20.
    *   Debate on whether even larger sizes might be needed in the future.
    *   Suggestion of potentially using multiple smaller prefixes or alternative approaches like "X::/16" in documentation.
    *   Argument that a single, large allocation is easier to filter.
*   **IP Ref: A Transitioning Technology:**
    *   Presentation of a new transitioning technology that doesn't require IPv4 addresses or an IPv4 internet during the transition.
    *   Based on the concept of IP Ref, an end-to-end address space translation.
    *   Discussion of its differences from existing technologies like LISP or HIP.
    *   Concerns about the commercial viability and deployment prospects, given the existing state of IPv6 transition.
    *   Question of how the system scales globally.
*   **Happy Eyeballs v3:**
    *   Discussion of the need to update the Happy Eyeballs algorithm.
    *   Addressing changes in DNS records (SVCB/HTTPS records) and transport protocols (QUIC).
    *   Consideration of security features (encrypted client hello) and their impact on the algorithm.
    *   Need to race until TLS is complete to avoid issues with TCP-terminating proxies.
    *   Discussion of the sorting algorithm and integration of SVCB priorities and ALPN capabilities.
    *   Debate about the appropriate working group for this document, given that it addresses not just IPv6 but also transport and security considerations.
*   **Scalability of Stateful NAT64 Implementations:**
    *   Presentation of performance measurements for stateful NAT64 implementations using OpenBSD pf.
    *   Consideration of factors such as maximum connection establishment rate, connection tear-down rate, and throughput.
    *   Discussion of the usefulness of these results for network operators.
    *   Debate whether RFC publication is the right avenue as data is constantly changing.
*   **Prefix Allocation on the LAN:**
    *   Discussion around promoting prefix delegation (PD) on home gateway LAN interfaces.
    *   Goal is to enable various technologies that can use prefixes in the home network.
    *   Concerns about hierarchical prefix allocation and whether it should be included in the document.
*   **7084 Biz:**
    *   Update of the 7084 informational RFC, focusing on cleaning up old text and removing transaction technologies.
    *   Discussion of ingress filtering.
    *   Concerns about EUI-64 usage on WAN interfaces and potential location tracking.
    *   Debate on requiring PD on the LAN interface, referencing the other Prefix Allocation on the LAN proposal.
*   **Host Requirements:**
    *   Proposal of a document regarding requirements for host configuration
    *   Discussion of if a generic solution can be found and the need to solve this issue
*   **NITK IPv6 Deployment Project:**
    *   Presentation on a student-led IPv6 deployment project at the National Institute of Technology in Karnataka, India.
    *   Details on the test bed setup, network size, IPv6 address allocation, and migrated applications (including their learning management system, Iris).
    *   Observations on IPv6 usage patterns across different operating systems (Windows, Android, Linux).
*   **IPv6-Only Deployment at Meta:**
    *   Presentation of experience deploying IPv6-only networks within a large enterprise.
    *   Focus on using DHCPv4 to signal IPv6-only capability to clients.
    *   Discussion of challenges, lessons learned, and interesting issues encountered.
    *   Lessons learnt: Only way network operators will deploy IPv6 when they run out of IPv4; dual-stack hides issues
    *   Discovery of many routers pretending to be hosts on the network.
    *   Discussion of extension headers and fragmentation.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Happy Eyeballs v3 Adoption:** Jen Mingoa stated that the draft would be adopted by the working group.
*   **Prefix Allocation on the LAN:** Requested to be adopted by the working group.
*   **7084 Biz:** Suggested that it should be updated after 10 years

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing lists for:
    *   The size of the documentation prefix.
    *   The adoption and refinement of the Happy Eyeballs v3 draft.
    *   7084 update.
    *   IPv6 enterprise network issues.
    *   Host requirements.
*   Present Happy Eyeballs draft at transport area meeting for input from transport and security experts.
*   Teams to prepare write-up about the implementation of IPv6 for presentation for working group.
