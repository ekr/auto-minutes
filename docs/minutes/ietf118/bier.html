<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 10 Nov 2023 14:30</p>
<h1>bier</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The BIER working group meeting covered several draft updates, a hackathon report, and discussions on new proposals related to source protection, DR election, and loop avoidance. Key topics included shepherding documents through the IETF process, scalability concerns with BIER-TE, and the need for practical deployments of BIER technology.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shepherding:</strong> The importance of volunteering as document shepherds to move drafts through the IETF process was emphasized. Several documents are in the ISG queue and require attention to address review comments.</li>
<li><strong>BIER-TE Scalability:</strong> A presentation explored alternative approaches to BIER-TE using bit-string and segment-encoded explicit trees to improve scalability in large networks.</li>
<li><strong>Source Protection:</strong> A draft on source protection in BIER was presented. Concerns were raised regarding its value compared to existing multicast redundancy mechanisms and whether BIER-specific solutions are necessary.</li>
<li><strong>DR Election:</strong> A draft proposing a protocol-independent Designated Router/Designated Forwarder (DRDF) election mechanism using RGP was discussed as a potential alternative to PIM-based DR election.</li>
<li><strong>Hackathon Report:</strong> A report on informal interoperability testing was presented, highlighting progress in forwarding and challenges in virtualized environments. Plans for more formal EANTC testing in March were announced.</li>
<li><strong>Loop Avoidance:</strong> A proposal to use segment routing for loop avoidance was presented, but participants questioned whether the problem was relevant and if workarounds were needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>OEM Requirements:</strong> A volunteer was found to trade shepherd roles.</li>
<li><strong>BIER BFD:</strong> The document is ready for working group last call and a shepherd will be assigned.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Performance Measurement:</strong> To reissue a last call for this document to remind people of the work.</li>
<li><strong>BIER Prefix Redistribution:</strong>  Needs a shepherd, Greg volunteered.</li>
<li><strong>BIER Source Protection:</strong>  The topic needs further discussion on the mailing list to determine if it is worth documenting.</li>
<li><strong>DRDF Election:</strong> An adoption call was made to start the process of standardization.</li>
<li><strong>OSPF Extensions (v2 &amp; v3):</strong> Send the document to the LSR working group for review.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to address review comments on documents in the ISG queue.</li>
<li>Continue discussion on the mailing list regarding source protection.</li>
<li>Continue planning for formal interoperability testing at EANTC in March.</li>
<li>Authors of the DRDF draft prepare for working group adoption.</li>
</ul>
