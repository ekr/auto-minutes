## Summary

The IETF roll meeting covered the status of various drafts, including RNAFD, MOPEX, enrollment priority, and NCA extension. Discussions revolved around clarifying ambiguities, addressing open issues, and planning next steps, including internal reviews, IESG submission and working group last calls. A significant point of discussion was whether the NCA extension should be based on the Mister Half objective function or be more generic. The experimental status of the doubt protection draft was also debated.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RNAFD Status:** The two drafts were submitted to the ISG. Reviews are pending.
*   **MOPEX:** Clarification needed on how old values are handled in the new mode of operation field. Concern was raised regarding defining or deprecating the legacy code. Discussion on potentially marking legacy code as reserved for future versions (Ripple v2).
*   **Enrollment Priority:** Updates published, Michael to double-check and publish.
*   **NCA Extension:** Addressed comments from Yana and Alvaro, now on version -12. Discussion on the use of "must" vs. "should" and the relevance of Mister Half in the specification. Recommendation was made to abstract to a generic objective function to broaden applicability.
*   **Doubt Protection:** Discussion regarding the experimental status of the draft and whether there has been any implementations or prototyping of the new additions.
*   **Interim Meetings:** Next interim meeting scheduled for January 25th, 1 PM UTC. Decision on whether to meet in person at IETF 119 in Brisbane is deferred due to low expected attendance.
*   **Deep Space:** Discussion on the suitability of Ripple for deep space communications, given its low chattiness and resilience to long propagation delays.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **MOPEX:** Dominique to improve comments in the issue, addressing the handling of old values in the new field and updating the RFC.
*   **Enrollment Priority:** Michael to publish the updated draft and then assign internal reviewers.
*   **NCA Extension:** Ari to explore generating the objective function more, and discuss further with Domique. Ari will bring it to the mailing list.
*   **Chairs:** Update meeting milestones.

## Next Steps

*   **RNAFD:** Await reviews from routing and security area directors.
*   **MOPEX:** Address open issues, then request internal reviews, routing and security area reviews, and proceed with working group last call.
*   **Enrollment Priority:** After publishing, assign internal reviewers, request routing and security director reviews, and proceed with working group last call.
*   **NCA Extension:** Defined if we need general form for the objective function.
