<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The WISH working group meeting at IETF 118 covered updates on the Wish Ingest Signaling Protocol (WISP), discussions around re-chartering the working group to include egress protocols (Web), and a presentation on a new proposal: WebRTC Interactive Signaling Protocol (WISP) for interactive media streaming. Decisions were made regarding the timeline for Web, and the handling of conflicting feedback from ADs on WISP.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Charter Re-chartering:</strong> The group agreed to re-charter to include work on egress protocols, focusing on the Web draft. A timeline for completion was discussed.</li>
<li><strong>WISP Updates:</strong> Sergio provided an update on WISP, addressing open issues and pull requests on GitHub. Conflicting directorate feedback regarding the level of detail about existing protocols (ICE, SDP) was discussed, with a decision to defer to ADs in case of unresolvable conflicts. Clarification regarding Ice restarts based on implementer feedback was discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Web Timeline:</strong> A tentative timeline of December 2024 was established for completing the Web draft within the working group, before handover to area directors.</li>
<li><strong>WebRTC Interactive Signaling Protocol (WISP) Presentation:</strong> Duping presented a draft on WISP for interactive media streaming scenarios. The presentation covered use cases and signaling procedures including ticket linking for merging, stream switching, grabbing and egressing.</li>
<li><strong>WISP Discussion:</strong> Concerns were raised regarding the service-specific nature of the proposed WISP, and whether it would promote interoperability between different implementations. The scope and expertise within the IETF were also discussed.  Suggestions were made regarding submitting pull requests to the WHEP draft for relevant features.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Timeline:</strong> Aim to have Web draft complete within the working group (including working group last call) by December 2024, followed by submission to the ISG.</li>
<li><strong>WISP Conflicting Feedback:</strong> In the event of conflicting feedback from two ADs on the WISP draft, the WISH chairs will defer to the ADs to resolve the conflict.</li>
<li><strong>WISP RFC Updates:</strong> WISP updates RFC8842. Add a header field to the document, like, the structure, right, and put updates 8442, put the sentence somewhere saying that we make it more strict because we're not getting backwards compatibility, which 8842, was intended, to be dealing with.</li>
<li><strong>WISP Review:</strong> Get PR to review the atrial changes to WISP.</li>
<li><strong>WISP to WHEP PRs:</strong> Duping is encouraged to submit PRs to the WHEP draft for features that are relevant and within scope.</li>
<li><strong>WISP Future:</strong> Discuss whether to extend the working group or create a new one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sergio to update the Web draft with a new date.</li>
<li>Sergio to continue addressing open issues on the WISP draft, focusing on the &quot;exact usage&quot; issue.</li>
<li>Review the pull request for atrial changes of WISP.</li>
<li>Duping to consider submitting PRs to WHEP for relevant WISP features.</li>
<li>Chairs to follow up on the potential adoption of WISP as future work for the group.</li>
</ul>
