<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 08 Nov 2023 08:30</p>
<h1>maprg</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The maprg session at IETF 118 featured a series of research presentations focusing on network measurement and performance analysis. Topics included QUIC performance, spin bit and ECN usage in QUIC, transparent DNS forwarders, DNS resolver behavior, RPKI deployment, IPv6 vs IPv4 latency, and the accuracy of location tracking tags.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>QUIC Performance:</strong> Several presentations examined the throughput and latency characteristics of QUIC implementations compared to TCP, highlighting potential performance bottlenecks related to CPU utilization, packet loss handling, and congestion control algorithms. Implementers are encouraged to provide clearer guidance on performance tuning.</li>
<li><strong>Spin Bit and ECN in QUIC:</strong> Studies revealed the limited adoption of ECN in QUIC despite it being mandatory. Issues with ECN validation due to network impairments and quick stack implementations were discussed. Spin bit usage sees wide forward use, but exhibited measurement accuracy issues and it's driven more by small to medium providers.</li>
<li><strong>Transparent DNS Forwarders:</strong> The session addressed the prevalence of misbehaving transparent DNS forwarders and their impact on amplification attacks. Solutions such as updating firewall filter rules were discussed.</li>
<li><strong>DNS Resolver Behavior:</strong> An analysis of public DNS resolvers revealed misconfigurations and transient behavior, particularly regarding DNSSEC validation and response correctness. This raises concerns about reliance of resolvers not acting as expected.</li>
<li><strong>RPKI Deployment:</strong> A new measurement platform was presented to assess RPKI deployment and protection levels, highlighting the increasing adoption of RPKI and its role in securing BGP.</li>
<li><strong>IPv6 vs IPv4 Latency:</strong> Research showed that latency differences between IPv6 and IPv4 vary depending on the source, destination, and time, indicating the importance of testing IPv6 for latency.</li>
<li><strong>Tracker Accuracy:</strong> Presentation covered the performance and accuracy of tracking tags used to find lost items. The location accuracy is within 60% on a radius of 10 meters. However, a better rate is achieved with more devices.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact Misconfigured Networks:</strong> Contact network operators running transparent forwarders to inform them of the issue.</li>
<li><strong>Share Data/Results:</strong> Presenters will share data and results with relevant working groups (e.g., QUIC, V6OPS).</li>
<li><strong>Future Research:</strong> Additional research will be done to analyze the accuracy of the overestimation in the spin bit measurements.</li>
<li><strong>Experimentation:</strong> Share experiment related to happy eyeballs and user priority with IPv6 OPS mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Speakers will continue to refine their research and potentially present updated findings in future maprg sessions.</li>
<li>Community members were encouraged to collaborate on measurement studies and tool development.</li>
</ul>
