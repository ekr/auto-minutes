# mboned

## Summary
The mboned meeting covered several topics related to multicast and its applications, including updates on active working group documents, multicast extensions to QUIC, analysis of Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) performance, and an update on the Tree Replication using Existing Technology In Networks (TrEE-in) draft. The discussions included technical details, potential challenges, and future directions for these technologies.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Telemetry Document:** Seeking a document shepherd for the telemetry document that passed working group last call in IETF 117.
*   **Yang Models:** Updates to the multicast Yang model draft were discussed, with a call for more review and comments.
*   **Multicast-to-Browser Drafts:** Plans to move the first three drafts (MVC, Back, and Doms) forward. Max Frank will take over feedback and Doms, and Kyle will take over MB.
*   **Multicast over QUIC:** An update was provided on the multicast extension to QUIC, including its architecture, security considerations, and potential use cases. Key areas of discussion included rekeying, retransmission, congestion control, integrity mechanisms, and the scope of ASM support. Concerns around congestion control were raised, and recommendations made to address them.
*   **BIER Performance:** An analysis of BIER performance in large networks was presented, covering topics like set identifier requirements, traffic models, clustering methods, and the impact of network topology. Discussions highlighted the importance of realistic receiver distributions and the potential for dynamic bit assignment.
*   **TrEE-in Draft:** An update was given on the TrEE-in draft, which is progressing in the Mops working group. The draft proposes using native multicast (SSM) combined with overlay technologies (AMT) to address the challenges of large-scale live streaming.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Max Frank:** volunteered to shepherd the telemetry draft.
*   **Authors of the Multicast over QUIC draft:**
    *   Consider adding ASM support in future versions.
    *   Address comments related to integrity and multi-channel support.
    *   Present at the Quick Working Group.
    *   Focus on developing realistic use cases.
*   **Authors of the BIER Performance Analysis:**
    *   Incorporate more realistic receiver distributions into the evaluation.

## Next Steps
*   Authors of the Multicast over QUIC draft plan to work with Lucas Pardue to make the implementations interoperable.
*   Authors of the TrEE-in draft to continue progress in the Mops working group, and seek feedback from the mboned group.
