<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Routing Area meeting covered several key topics, including updates from Area Directors, a report on the Routing Area Director (RAD) function, and a discussion about agenda item inclusion criteria for working group meetings. Sue Harris presented insights from her PhD dissertation on leadership in standards organizations and the IESG.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Area Director Updates:</strong>  Area Directors welcomed a new LSR co-chair (Jing Jin Koo) and an interim MPLS chair (Adrian Farrell). They emphasized the smooth operation of working groups in the area.</li>
<li><strong>Routing Area Director (RAD) Update:</strong> RAD co-chair Daniel Enriquez provided a report on document reviews, reviewer assignments, and upcoming process improvements.  Key areas of focus: Improving turnaround time for reviews, and streamlining the accept/reject process for reviewers.</li>
<li><strong>Working Group Agenda Item Inclusion Criteria:</strong> Discussion centered on a proposal to require mailing list discussion prior to a draft appearing on a working group agenda.  The goals are to ensure more participants have read and considered documents before in-person discussions and to improve efficiency in the limited face-to-face time.  A number of exceptions were discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Author List Length:</strong>  A lengthy discussion occurred regarding author lists on drafts. Suggestions included removing the existing limit, and having a tracked history of who contributed text to documents. Concerns were raised about motivations for adding authors (bonuses, corporate support vs. actual contribution) and related impacts to credibility.</li>
<li><strong>Sue Harris Presentation:</strong> Sue Harris presented research on effective IESG leadership and dynamics, sharing insights on data-driven measures, the importance of solidarity, and the need for ADs to act as good managers and inspiring leaders.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>RAD Process Improvement:</strong> Daniel Enriquez to follow up with reviewers to ensure timely acknowledgment (accept/reject) of document review assignments. If no response within 7 days, the document will be reassigned.</li>
<li><strong>WG Agenda Item Inclusion Guidelines:</strong> The Area Directors will refine the proposal for working group agenda item inclusion criteria based on the discussion, with the understanding that it should be a guideline and not a strict rule. They will engage with working group chairs in a follow-up discussion. Some changes to the wording of the guidelines should be considered around items such as 'new drafts' and external presentations.</li>
<li><strong>Action Items regarding author list length:</strong> ADs to consider and follow up on all feedback and suggestions.</li>
<li><strong>Tooling:</strong> Check for better data tracker tooling to notify users via email of new LSR drafts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Area Directors to schedule a working group chairs chat to further discuss the agenda item inclusion proposal.</li>
<li>Area Directors to discuss data tracker updates for tracking LSR drafts.</li>
<li>Area Directors to discuss any potential updates to the draft author guidelines.</li>
</ul>
