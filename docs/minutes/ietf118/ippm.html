## Summary
The IPPM working group meeting at IETF 118 covered updates on adopted working group documents, including hybrid two-step telemetry, encrypted PDM data integrity, and responsiveness in STAMP. The meeting also addressed documents under discussion for adoption, such as the STAMP extension for IOM, and concluded with lightning talks on new internet drafts. Key topics included security reviews, potential working group last calls, adoption call, and the need for clear explanations and implementations.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Hybrid Two-Step Telemetry:** Updates were provided, and comments received during the working group adoption poll are being addressed.
*   **Encrypted PDM Data Integrity:**  SecDir review suggestions were implemented, including changes to threat model, privacy considerations, and cipher suite selection. Another SecDir review is planned, with a request for community review in parallel.
*   **Responsiveness in STAMP (Network Quality):** Strong support for moving to working group last call.  Discussion on gaming the system and the importance of application-layer responsiveness. Updates on well-known URI, name picked for consistency.
*   **STAMP YANG Model:**  Document temporarily expired but has been renewed. Focus is now on including STAMP extensions into the model.  An early YANG doctor review is being sought.
*   **STAMP Extension for IOM:**  Discussion on requirements, asymmetric packet sizes, and multiple STAMP TLVs. After discussion it was decided to hold off on the adoption call.
*   **STAMP Extensions for Hop-by-Hop Data Collection:** Initial presentation of the document covering hop-by-hop delay, loss, and bandwidth measurements. The use of HMAC for security was discussed.
*   **Quality of Outcome Draft (Network Quality Framework):** Outlines essential features for a network quality framework, targeting end users, application developers, and operators. There was a second attempt to reopen adoption call to the working group.
*   **Alternate Marking Deployment Guide:** Discussion on applicability in controller domains and configuration aspects. Need to remove reference of I-D 8799.
*   **Asymmetric STAMP:** Extension can be used in one-way or rate measurement modes and enhances security considerations.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Encrypted PDM Data Integrity:** Authors to confirm changes with previous SecDir reviewer and then email the chairs directly. Chairs will then kick off a formal SecDir review.
*   **Encrypted PDM Data Integrity:** Authors to add their implementation to the Wiki page.
*   **Encrypted PDM Data Integrity:** Email tariffs directly once changes are confirmed by the reviewer.
*   **IPOM data fields integrity:** The security director to assign a different reviewer
*   **Responsiveness in STAMP:** Review the list, and try to address all open issues on the document, before kicking off for last call.
*   **Alternate Marking Deployment Guide:** Remove reference to I-D 8799 and reuse the controller domain definitions from RFC 9341 and 9343.
*   **Stamp Extension for IOM:** Handle the comments, provide a new revision, and then there will be a talk of when it's appropriate for adoption.
*   **Network Quality Framework:** Members of the group urged to read the document.
*   **Alternate Marking Young data model:** merge the effort between the two drafts that currently exist

## Next Steps
*   Continued discussion on the mailing lists for all documents under development.
*   Address open issues and comments on drafts to prepare them for working group last call or future adoption calls.
*   Schedule follow-up discussions and meetings to resolve specific technical questions.
