<h1>icnrg Meeting Minutes</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The ICNRG meeting covered several topics, including updates on existing drafts, adoption calls for new drafts (reflexive forwarding), discussions on FLIC manifest updates, NDN testbed and traffic trace analysis, collective communication optimization for distributed AI, and a proposed distributed architecture for microservice communication. The meeting emphasized experimentation, practical work, and learning from real-world system implementations.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reflexive Forwarding:</strong> Dave Oran presented an update on the reflexive forwarding draft, highlighting its relevance for transactional communication in ICN and the need for broader review due to its modification of forwarding behavior. An adoption call will be issued.</li>
<li><strong>FLIC Manifest Updates:</strong> Mark presented updates to the FLIC draft, specifically focusing on a new option for segmented schema interest construction. The discussion covered the flexibility offered by FLIC and the importance of recommending a simple, systematic approach to avoid confusion. A call was made for reimplementation and experimentation.</li>
<li><strong>NDN Testbed and Traffic Traces:</strong> Davida presented work on collecting and analyzing traffic traces from an NDN testbed. The discussion highlighted the importance of traffic traces for research, limitations of the current dataset, and potential next steps, including expanding data collection and improving anonymization techniques. A call for participation in using the dataset and contributing to the toolkit was made.</li>
<li><strong>Collective Communication Optimization:</strong> Kirhan presented ideas on optimizing collective communication for distributed AI model training by offloading operations to the network. The discussion focused on transport issues, design issues related to management and operations, security considerations, and challenges in interoperability with existing internet architectures.</li>
<li><strong>Microservice Architectures:</strong> Shooting presented a proposed distributed architecture for microservice communication using ICN principles. The discussion covered the motivation for the architecture, its key components, and challenges in achieving efficient name-based forwarding. The need for design options and feedback from the group was requested.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reflexive Forwarding Adoption Call:</strong> Dirk and Dave will issue an adoption call for the reflexive forwarding draft.</li>
<li><strong>FLIC Reimplementation:</strong> Mark will help anyone who has resources to work on FLIC.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Traces Analysis:</strong> The group encourages researchers to use the provided traffic traces and provide feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Members are encouraged to review the reflexive forwarding draft and provide feedback.</li>
<li>Mark will help anyone reimplement FLIC and experiment with it.</li>
<li>Researchers are encouraged to utilize and analyze the NDN traffic traces.</li>
<li>Further discussion on design options for the microservice architecture is planned.</li>
<li>Attend the metaverse site meeting and the hardware/performance oriented AI and data center meeting.</li>
</ul>
