## Summary

This session focused on two key topics: improving terrestrial connectivity in Africa and the phenomenon of remote peering. The first part of the session featured a presentation by Theo Benson on connectivity challenges in Africa, focusing on the need to keep traffic local. The second half featured a presentation on the work of Commit Global and the internet resilience index. Finally, a panel discussion was held on remote peering.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Connectivity in Africa (Theo Benson):**
    *   Performance and reliability are still poor in Africa, with much traffic transiting through Europe.
    *   Subsea cables are increasing, but terrestrial connectivity remains a challenge.
    *   Questions remain about adding IXPs and local/remote peering.
    *   Incentivizing content providers to locate in different African locations is crucial.
    *   Africa is not monolithic, and solutions should be region-specific.
    *   Need for data from the data plane, control plane, and management plane to inform changes.
*   **Commit Global (Andre):**
    * Addresses technology as an enabler, not as a means to an end
    * Provides technological assistance to Ukraine refugees
    * Seeks to unlock the promise of tech social good
*   **Internet Resilience Index (Matt Ford):**
    *   The Internet Society Pulse hosts the Internet Resilience Index.
    *   Index is based on infrastructure, performance, security, and market readiness pillars.
    *   Methodology and data sources are detailed in a separate document.
    *   Index allows for comparing countries and identifying specific weaknesses for policymakers.
    *   Sustainability was suggested as a fifth pillar.
*   **Remote Peering Panel Discussion:**
    *   Definition of remote peering is challenging, especially concerning latency.
    *   Distinction between IP transit and remote peering (BGP layer vs. commercial difference).
    *   Reasons for remote peering: cost, access to larger IXPs/content providers, gaming companies.
    *   Downsides: obfuscation of network paths, potential centralization of IXP infrastructure, latency concerns for certain regions (e.g., Africa), human capacity limitations.
    *   Possible solutions: content localization, incentivizing hosting within countries, defined community

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Vesna to connect with Matt Ford and the Internet Society to explore adding sustainability as a pillar to the Internet Resilience Index.

## Next Steps

*   Continue the discussion and research on remote peering benefits and drawbacks.
*   Explore policy incentives for content localization in Africa.
*   Address skills/capacity building for network operators in developing regions.
*   Follow-up on the potential of an international Ixp fabric.
