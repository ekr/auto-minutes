# jmap Session

## Summary

The jmap session covered several documents and working group items, including jmap Sieve, sharing, contacts, calendars, s MIME sender, tasks, and portability.  A significant portion of the discussion revolved around S/MIME sender extensions, the proposed re-chartering of the EXTRA working group to handle broader email-related work, and auto-configuration. There were discussions on potential adoption calls for several drafts and updates to milestones.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **jmap Sieve:**  Ready for submission to ASG.
*   **Sharing, Contacts, Calendars:** Nearing last call, with discussion of JS Contact and JS Calendar dependencies.  Robert noted that JS Calendar Biz is not blocking.
*   **S/MIME Sender:** Debate between a simpler current version and a more extensible alternative.  Discussion about whether this should be a property of the message object or an argument to email set.  Ken emphasized chaining use cases. York highlighted the need for operational parameters and property. The group decided on experimenting with a more flexible approach, moving it to email set parameters.
*   **jmap Tasks:** Update and synchronization with jmap calendars are needed. No major roadblocks.
*   **jmap Portability:** Request for adoption call on the main draft and related extensions (debug logging, backend info, rest mapping).
*   **EXTRA Re-chartering:**  Discussion about expanding the charter to handle a wider range of email-related topics. Debate about merging EXTRA and JMAP or creating a more general "email dumping ground" working group.  Ron and Marie to work on proposed charter text.
*   **I'm at Gem of Access:** Revision needed to re-add security considerations.
*   **RFC 6855 (UTF8 Addresses):**  Ben proposed removing the UTF8 addresses flag. The consensus seems to be that the flag is useless. Discussion about its original purpose and problems around the implementation of EAI in IMAP clients. Further discussion planned over lunch.
*   **IMAP Puskeys:** Discussion about adoption and applicability with IMAP, also raised the non-interactive authentication challenge. Moved to the Kitten working group.
*   **IMAP Your ID Only:**  Small update related to reporting.  Ready for working group last call. Lexi to address the issue with the client asking for UID only.
*   **IMAP Message Limits:** Updates based on feedback, including clarifications and exemptions for certain commands.  Discussion about the 1000 message limit (proposed change to "should"). Awaiting Brian's individual comments.
*   **IMAP In Progress:** In working group last call until the end of the week. Discussion about the percentage and having 2 numbers.
*   **Sieve Calendar:** Discussed issues with multiple calendar parts, inline attachments, and leveraging extended list for organizer addresses. Revision and focus on security considerations needed.
*   **List Metadata:** Relatively simple extension. Can be moved to last call next week.
*   **Auto Config:**  Presentation of the proposed format and discovery methods.  Concerns raised about security, URL guessing, and database maintenance. A working group needs to be formed on these features. A new document is needed for the features mentioned for what the thunder bird does.
*   **Big Files:** Proposed new functionality regarding references to external attachments within email.
