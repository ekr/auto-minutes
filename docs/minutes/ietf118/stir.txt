## Summary

The STIR working group met to discuss three main documents: Connected Identity, Certificate Lifetimes, and STIR with MLS. Discussions centered on updates to the Connected Identity draft, the adoption of a short-lived certificate draft, and potential integration points between STIR and MLS, including MLS credential types. An action item was created for calls of adoption for short-lived certificate and MLS drafts. Other business regarding identity was briefly discussed.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Service Provider OOB:** The group decided to proceed with processing the Service Provider OOB document as standards track, following a prior consensus call on the list.
*   **Connected Identity:** Discussed updates to the Connected Identity draft based on feedback from Jonathan Rosenberg, including adding a 2FA use case, clarifying normative statements, and clarifying application to CANCEL messages. The group acknowledged no objections but also a lack of enthusiasm.
*   **Certificate Lifetimes:** Explored OCSP stapling and short-lived certificates as approaches to managing dynamic telephone number ownership within certificates. Discussed the trade-offs of each approach. Defined X5C and Staple approach. Agreed to change the short lived certificate lifetime recommendation to three days.
*   **STIR with MLS:** Explored defining new MLS credential types for RFC 8226 certificates and passports. Discussed the security implications of using service provider certificates versus delegate certificates in MLS.
