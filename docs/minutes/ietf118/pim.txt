## Summary

The PIM working group meeting covered a wide range of topics, including working group status, document updates, new draft adoptions, and presentations on various multicast-related technologies. Key discussions revolved around PIM light, point-to-multipoint policies, group address allocation protocol (GAAP), zero-configuration multicast address assignment, scalable multicast forwarding using local bitstrings, EVPN integration with PIM, and adaptive tree multicast.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Working Group Status:** Three new RFCs published since the last meeting. Working group last call to be initiated for GMP version, MLD version 2, and IIM updates. Review requests emphasized.
*   **PIM Light:** Modifications made based on previous IETF feedback. Concerns raised regarding complexity creep and the need to keep PIM Light simple.  DF election algorithm from other working groups was referenced as a possible solution.
*   **Point-to-Multipoint Policy:** Replication segment draft is in the RFC editor queue. SRV6 support added. Last call requested for the policy draft due to lack of feedback.
*   **GAAP (Group Address Allocation Protocol):** Discussed handling of multiple address families (IPv4/IPv6) and ASM/SSM range allocation. Strong disagreement on whether GAAP should support SSM.
*   **Zero-Configuration Multicast Address Assignment:** Presented a demo of the MDNS-based solution and discussed the "null and void" port concept for multicast applications.
*   **Scalable Multicast Forwarding:** Proposed a method using local bitstrings and sets for more scalable multicast forwarding, potentially addressing issues in large networks with global bitstrings.
*   **EVPN Integration with PIM:** Discussed challenges and solutions for integrating PIM with EVPN, including reducing soft state messages and preventing traffic multiplication.
*   **Adaptive Tree Multicast:** Presented an adaptive stately tree multicast approach that combined multiple encoding methods.
*   **MP MLD Proxy with Multiple Upstream Interfaces:** Proposal to extend existing MP MLD proxies to support multiple upstream interfaces.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Working Group Last Call:** To be initiated for GMP version, MLD version 2, and IIM updates.
*   **Point-to-Multipoint Policy:** Working group last call to be initiated after mailing list discussion.
*   **GAAP (Group Address Allocation Protocol):** An issue to be opened on the mailing list for further discussion of ASM/SSM support.
*   **Yang Model:** The Chair will take it to the list asking for the chairs to ensure its approval.
*   **MP MLD Proxy with Multiple Upstream Interfaces:** Bring to the list, and eventually will ask for working group adoption

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address feedback and continue refining drafts.
*   Further discussion on the mailing list to resolve disagreements and refine proposals.
*   Explore the potential for hardware implementation and researcher collaboration for scalable multicast solutions.
*   Coordinate with other working groups (e.g., SPRING, BEER, BEST) as necessary.
