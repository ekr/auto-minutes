## Summary

The Quantum Internet Research Group (QIRG) meeting covered a range of topics related to quantum communication and networking, including QKD networks, entangled networks, and architectural frameworks. The meeting featured presentations on real-world QKD deployments, security concerns in quantum cryptography, and forward-looking ideas for quantum internet addressing.  A key theme was leveraging existing QKD infrastructure and knowledge to inform the development of future entangled networks.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **QKD and Quantum Internet Synergies:**  The group discussed the relevance of QKD efforts to the QIRG, highlighting the potential for QKD networks to evolve into entanglement-based networks, particularly in control and management layers.
*   **Architectural Framework for Quantum Internet:** A presentation proposed an architectural framework for quantum internet, emphasizing agility, sustainability, and playability (adaptability to classical network management). The framework considers service, quantum forwarding, and connectivity strata.
*   **DemoDom Project:**  The DemoDom project, focused on building a QKD network in Germany, was presented.  The discussion covered the challenges of controlling such a network, key management systems, and the use of an SDN controller. A live demonstration was shown using containerized emulations.
*   **Security Threats in Quantum Cryptography:**  Presentations explored vulnerabilities in quantum cryptography protocols due to message losses.  The discussion included potential mitigation strategies and a call for more in-depth security assessments of QKD protocols.
*   **Quantum Internet Addressing:** A presentation challenged the traditional assumptions of classical internet addressing, advocating for a quantum addressing scheme that leverages the unique properties of entanglement. The presenter noted it was an idea but without an implementation, asking for a more radical rethinking about entanglement-based networks.
*   **Integration with 6G:** The discussion covered the potential role of quantum technologies in future 6G networks. Key Performance Indicators were mentioned, and potential integration with 5G networks.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Continue working on the architectural framework document:**  The draft document will continue to be developed, with a focus on identifying and classifying current proposals for interfaces and protocols within the framework.
*   **Security Assessments of QKD protocols:** The group recognized the need to focus more on security assessments of QKD Protocols.

## Next Steps

*   **Circulate announcements via QIRG mailing list:** Rodney will send emails to the QIRG mailing list regarding the Workshop for Quantum Repeaters and Networks (WQRAN), the release of an undergraduate textbook on quantum communications, and the planned survey paper on routing in quantum networks.
*   **WQRAN Call for Participation:** Interested individuals are encouraged to contact the organizers and follow announcements on the WQRAN website (wqrn.org).
*   **Routing in Quantum Networks Survey Paper:** Those interested in participating in the survey paper are encouraged to contact Rodney or Shota.
