## Summary
The BMWG session at IETF 118 covered a range of topics, including updates on existing drafts, new proposals for benchmarking methodologies, and discussions regarding the applicability and scope of these methodologies in various network environments. Key areas of focus included segment routing (MPLS and IPv6), stateful NATxy gateways, containerized network functions, and integrated space-terrestrial networks. Several action items and requests for working group adoption were proposed.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **MLR Search Draft:** Presentation on the MLR search draft, emphasizing its applicability to software networking and addressing challenges like long search times, DUT/SUT interference, and non-zero loss. Seeking more reviewers and contributors.
*   **Stateful NATxy Gateway Benchmarking:** Presentation on benchmarking stateful NATxy gateways using RFC 4814 and related standards. Demonstrated validation of the methodology with different stateful NAT44 implementations. Request for Working Group Last Call.
*   **Benchmarking with Multiple IP Addresses:** Proposal for amending RFC 2544 and RFC 4814 to address challenges related to RSS (Receive Side Scaling) implementations and unfairness in benchmarking environments.
*   **Benchmarking Containerized Network Functions:** Presentation on considerations for benchmarking network performance in container infrastructures, including CPU isolation, Numa affinity, and CNI (Container Network Interface) configurations. Support expressed for adoption of this work.
*   **Segment Routing (SR) Benchmarking (MPLS & IPv6):** Discussions on separate drafts for SR-MPLS and SRv6 benchmarking. Carsten emphasized significant overlap between the two drafts. There were debates about the added value of these benchmarks compared to existing MPLS methodologies and arguments for their adoption.
*   **Integrated Space-Terrestrial Networks (ISTN) Benchmarking:** Presentation on considerations for edge benchmarking mass storage for reliable transport protocols in integrated space and terrestrial networks. Real trace data was collected.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Stateful NATxy Gateway Benchmarking:** Action: The chairs will evaluate the draft and determine if Working Group Last Call can be initiated.
*   **Benchmarking Containerized Network Functions:** Action: Take it to the list to solicit input around adoption.
*   **SR-MPLS & SRv6 Benchmarking:** Action: Authors to address concerns about the duplication between drafts and added value. Carsten to provide pointers to testing resources to Majic.
*   **ISTN Benchmarking:** Action: Take discussion to the mailing list for review and feedback.
*   **MLR Search Draft:** Action: Ratco to update MLR search slides and send to Chairs. Majic to arrange a bar-b-q after the Happy Hour at the ILMP booth.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions and solicit feedback on all presented drafts via the BMWG mailing list.
*   The chairs will assess the feedback and determine the next steps for each draft, including potential working group adoption and last call.
*   Determine if the discussions on the list require an interim meeting.
*   Ratco and Majic to discuss MLR Search and the draft's progress in a bar-b-q after the Happy Hour at the ILMP booth.
