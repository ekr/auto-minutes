## Summary
This meeting covered the status of several CBOR-related drafts, including EDN Literals, Update 8610 Grammar, Aktivo/CBOR Pack, and a DNS over CBOR format. The deterministic CBOR (DCBOR) effort was discussed, focusing on a common deterministic encoding profile. Decisions were made to extend the working group last call for EDN Literals and Update 8610 Grammar, and to start a call for adoption of the common deterministic encoding profile.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **EDN Literals and Update 8610 Grammar:**  A working group last call was extended for one week to gather more feedback on both documents. There was a call for simplified feedback.
*   **Aktivo/CBOR Pack:** Discussion revolved around reference tables, shared items, argument items, and function tags within the CBOR Pack specification. Table building was identified as a potentially application-specific area for innovation. The difficulties of using maps in combination with incremental table building were discussed.
*   **DNS over CBOR:** The presentation covered a concise CBOR-based DNS message format, including omitting DNS fields for efficiency and utilizing name compression. Two name compression strategies were presented: component referencing and a lighter version of CBOR Pack. There was debate as to whether to use pack, or to use the implicit table structure that is already familiar.
*   **Deterministic CBOR (DCBOR):** There are two documents relating to deterministic Cbor that need to be merged. One from Karsten, and one from Wolf. The discussion centered around the need for a common deterministic encoding profile for CBOR, specifically whether `2` should be treated the same as `2.0`. The group expressed support for adopting a common profile, with a decision on BCP versus Standards Track to be determined later.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Extend the working group last call for EDN Literals and Update 8610 Grammar for one week.
*   **Decision:** Start a call for adoption of the common deterministic encoding profile for CBOR on the mailing list.
*   **Action Item:** Karsten and Wolf to collaborate on merging their DCBOR documents into one.
*   **Action Item:** Investigate the potential of adding a slicing reference to CBOR Pack.
*   **Action Item:** Discuss the issue of query counts greater than 1 in DNS, as raised by Donald Eastlake, offline.

## Next Steps

*   Gather feedback on EDN Literals and Update 8610 Grammar during the extended working group last call.
*   Begin the call for adoption of the common deterministic encoding profile.
*   Karsten and Wolf to merge their documents on DCBOR.
*   Continued discussion and development of Aktivo/CBOR Pack, addressing outstanding merits and potential benchmarks.
*   Evaluate the two DNS/CBOR name compression approaches and make a decision on which direction to pursue.
