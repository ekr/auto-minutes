<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This Birds of a Feather (BoF) session focused on detecting unwanted location trackers. The main goals were to review the proposed system architecture, discuss the charter, and determine if there's sufficient community agreement and interest to form a working group within the IETF. Key discussions revolved around the scope of the working group, particularly whether it should include a standardized definition or baseline algorithm for &quot;unwanted tracking&quot; detection, client authentication, and addressing privacy and security considerations, including potential harms to survivors of abuse. A vote was taken, and there was overwhelming support for forming a working group.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scope of &quot;Unwanted Tracking&quot; Detection:</strong> A central point of debate was whether the working group should define a standardized algorithm or guidance for detecting unwanted tracking, or focus solely on the underlying signals and protocols. Concerns were raised that excluding detection would render the group's work less useful and potentially introduce problems with false positives and implementation inconsistencies across different platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Client Authentication:</strong> There was a discussion about requiring client authentication for trackers participating in the network to prevent unauthorized devices from using the network and potentially engaging in malicious activities.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy and Security Considerations:</strong> Participants emphasized the importance of considering privacy and security implications, including potential harms to survivors of intimate partner violence and the need to avoid creating new tracking vectors. Engagement with advocacy groups and experts in gender-based violence was strongly encouraged.</li>
<li><strong>Evidence of Efficacy:</strong> A call was made for the working group to demonstrate the efficacy of its proposed solutions in reducing harm before publishing RFCs. This sparked debate about how to measure efficacy and what constitutes sufficient evidence.</li>
<li><strong>Device Scope:</strong> Clarification was sought on the types of devices considered in scope. The consensus was to focus on accessories with low inherent location capabilities, excluding phones, tablets, watches, and laptops.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy Device Handling:</strong> Ensuring that the protocol can properly detect and act on devices that cannot be firmware updated</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Charter Modifications:</strong> The chairs and document editors will incorporate the following changes into the charter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate Ecker's suggestion on baseline algorithms</li>
<li>Expand the background section to acknowledge the existence of tracker networks and highlight the gap being addressed.</li>
<li>Add a requirement for client authentication, expressed as a desired security property rather than a specific mechanism.</li>
<li>Add a statement about working with abuse advocacy groups</li>
<li>Add language requiring a global perspective</li>
<li>Clarify the role of the IETF and it's members to solve for the need that all devices should not be tracked, and provide better on/off controls</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Next Consensus Call:</strong> The revised charter will be circulated to the mailing list for a final consensus call before submission to the IESG.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>The chairs will refine the charter based on the feedback received during the BoF session and circulate it to the mailing list.</li>
<li>After the charter is available, another consensus call will be announced.</li>
<li>Once consensus is confirmed, the charter will be submitted to the IESG for consideration.</li>
</ul>
