<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 09 Nov 2023 12:00</p>
<h1>gendispatch</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The gendispatch session in Prague covered three main topics: removing the expiration date from Internet Drafts, re-licensing RFCs to allow derivative works, and modifying the nomcom appointment structure for greater continuity. There was support for exploring the removal of expiration dates from Internet Drafts, likely through a mini-working group.  The proposal to re-license RFCs to allow derivative works raised significant concerns, especially regarding potential misuse and the IETF's brand. Changes to nomcom appointments did not get consensus.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internet Draft Expiration:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The current expiration date doesn't accurately reflect the relevance of drafts and creates unnecessary busywork.</li>
<li>Expiration dates might steer newcomers away from useful but expired drafts.</li>
<li>There's a need for better signals about whether a draft is still active.</li>
<li>The discussion should consider stream specific requirements for individual and independent submission streams.</li>
<li>Existing data tracker functionality for marking drafts as &quot;dead&quot; could be used more effectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>RFC Re-licensing (Flatware):</strong>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to allow derivative works based on RFCs, enabling continued maintenance by other entities.</li>
<li>Current licenses are more restrictive than open-source licenses.</li>
<li>Potential for market confusion with forked standards and concern for misuse.</li>
<li>Concerns about IETF branding and the ability to protect its intellectual property.</li>
<li>Existing licenses may not permit derivative works.</li>
<li>The IETF does not currently trademark any protocol names.</li>
<li>Concern raised that changes may facilitate regulators to demand changes based upon illegitimate forks.</li>
<li>The value of the IETF is in its consensus process, not just the documents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nomcom Structure:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The proposal is to create 2-year staggered terms for nomcom members and a 3-year staggered term for the chair.</li>
<li>The current nomcom process can be rushed, leading to less considered appointments.</li>
<li>Concerns regarding reduced randomness and potential for stagnation and reduced diversity.</li>
<li>Potential reduction in volunteer pool.</li>
<li>Greater risk of &quot;stuffing the ballot box.&quot;</li>
<li>The complicated system already in use may not be improved through further complexity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internet Draft Expiration:</strong> A mini-working group will likely be formed to further investigate and discuss the removal of Internet Draft expiration dates. The AD will be notified of the decision.</li>
<li><strong>RFC Re-licensing:</strong>  Further discussion will be added to the mailing list. Additional work is needed. A non-working group forming BoF was also suggested.</li>
<li><strong>Nomcom Structure:</strong> More clarity is needed, and the proposal is not ready for consideration by the broader IETF. The likely outcome is no action.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internet Draft Expiration:</strong> Follow-up on the list to organize a mini-working group.</li>
<li><strong>RFC Re-licensing:</strong> Continue discussion on the mailing list and evaluate if a non working group forming BoF will be scheduled.</li>
<li><strong>Nomcom Structure:</strong> Rick to collect feedback from those interested and possibly organize discussion in future.</li>
</ul>
