## Summary

This anima working group meeting covered the status of several drafts related to BRUSKI (Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure), including updates on existing drafts and discussion on new work proposals. Key discussion points included discovery mechanisms, voucher formats, and enrollment protocols, particularly for constrained IoT environments. The meeting addressed the restructuring of existing efforts to improve progress and promote interoperability, and touched upon potential new work in lightweight GRASP and certificate-related BRUSKI extensions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **BRUSKI Cloud Status:** Awaiting shepherd write-up and AD queueing.
*   **CAD366bis Status:** Shepherd review received, work needed to address Yang utility issues.
*   **Anima Network Service Auto Deployment:** Potential to park this to serialize work with GRASP distribution.
*   **BRUSKI AE (Authentication Extension):** Shepherd will execute the Shepherd role with the goal of having it pass AD review before the end of the AD's term. There is a proposal to restructure Bruski, including moving some advanced discovery tech out to speed up the other documents.
*   **Extended Feature Sets of Registers:** A promising draft in Brewski discovery handling extended feature sets, discovery. The current draft refers to it. A fallback strategy for existing implementations is to use a specific service name.
*   **JWS Vouchers:** Ready for IETF review, awaiting IANA registration for application voucher (JWS plus JC). Need to get a reply from the designated expert. Decided to move forward with the process, even without the reply.
*   **BRUSKI with Pledge and Responder Mode (PRM):** Updated draft to address remaining issues from working group last call. There is the intention to restructure to have a better way through the document. The proposal is to keep a simple assumption in PRM that the registrar and the registrar agent are known by configuration. The Registrar Agent needs to discover pledges. It is assumed that DNS-SD with MDNS is used.
*   **COAP BRUSKI (Constrained BRUSKI):** Discussion on various discovery options, recommendation of using COAP discovery as a default, with other options deferred to future documents. Concern raised about forward compatibility with COAP and backward compatibility with RFC 8995.
*   **BRUSKI Discovery:** Discussion of the advantages of having flexible discovery across the different implementations.
*    **轻量级 GRASP**: A proposal of a lightweight grasp

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **BRUSKI Cloud:** Shepherd to complete write-up.
*   **JWS Vouchers:** Proceed with IETF review despite pending IANA registration confirmation; send an email to media man at the time it goes to IETF last call.
*   **BRUSKI with Pledge and Responder Mode (PRM):** Finalize text in the design team. Update the draft. Ask Charlie Kaufman to do the sector review again. Fire's cover to go ahead and do the write up afterwards.
*   **COAP BRUSKI (Constrained BRUSKI):** Define a default discovery method with COAP discovery and core link format. A Creditor is needed.
*   **BRUSKI Discovery:** Move to working group status after updates incorporating discussion feedback.
*   Update slides from Monday's site meeting work.

## Next Steps

*   Address remaining open issues in various BRUSKI drafts based on meeting discussions.
*   Progress drafts to IETF review and AD queue as applicable.
*   Continue discussion on new work proposals (lightweight GRASP, certificate BRUSKI extensions) on the mailing list.
*   Finalize the proposed discovery solution and update relevant documents.
*   The co-authors would like to see the moved to working group status of the discovery document.
