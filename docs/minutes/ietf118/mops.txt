## Summary

The MOPS (Media Operations) working group met at IETF 118. The meeting covered updates on two drafts: one on media for extended reality applications on edge computing infrastructure and another on 3D networks. There was also a presentation from the Streaming Video Technology Alliance (SVTA) on their ongoing work and projects. The meeting concluded with a discussion on potential future work items for the working group.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **XR on Edge Computing Draft Security Considerations:** A new section on security considerations was added to the XR on Edge Computing draft. Concerns were raised regarding the level of detail, with suggestions to keep the section broad and aligned with existing streaming application security practices.
*   **3D Networks Draft Last Call:** The working group discussed the readiness of the 3D networks draft for working group last call. A vote was held, resulting in a decision to proceed with the last call. The need for active participation and feedback on the mailing list during the last call was emphasized.
*   **SVTA Update:** The SVTA provided an update on their activities, including the formation of a streaming audio study group, upcoming segments conferences, the launch of the Common Media Library, open caching performance data, an online university, a streaming video Wiki, and a document numbering system.
*   **Future Work Items:** The working group discussed potential future work items, including a draft addressing potential issues with the Mask protocol redirecting clients to less optimal caches, Glen was seeking co-authors for the draft.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **XR on Edge Computing Draft:**
    *   **Action:** Shorten the security considerations section to be more general and align with standard streaming security practices. The updated draft will then be submitted to the ISG in 2 weeks.

*   **3D Networks Draft:**
    *   **Decision:** Proceed with working group last call.
    *   **Action:** Chris Lemons will serve as the document shepherd for the 3D Networks draft.

## Next Steps

*   **Mailing List Discussion:** Working group members were encouraged to actively participate in discussions on the mailing list, particularly during the 3D Networks draft's last call.
*   **Identify New Work:** The working group will discuss and identify potential new work items to pursue in the near future, potentially for discussion at IETF 119 in Brisbane. Glen will post a draft addressing Mask and CDN caching issues to the mailing list.
