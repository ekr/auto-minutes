<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 05 Nov 2023 17:00</p>
<h1>Hot RFC Lightning Talks</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This session featured a series of lightning talks on various topics of interest to the IETF community. The talks covered a wide range of subjects, including IPv6 usability, sustainability in networking, inter-domain routing architecture (SCION), collective communication offloading, universal name systems, zero-touch routing (Kira), IoT security in the post-quantum era, JSON Web Token (JWT) revocation, methods for reducing post-quantum signature sizes (MTL mode), personal digital agent protocols, and a new method for secure eduroam configuration using FIDO keys. The purpose of this session was to encourage conversation around these topics and solicit feedback from the community.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>IPv6 Usability:</strong>  Just Busting presented on a new KPI for IPv6 usability and findings from various continents, including the observation that fixed CPE IPv6 requirements are a big topic.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainability in Networking:</strong> Amil and presented on experiments in energy reduction and broader sustainability considerations, including circular economy principles, normalization of data sources, and accuracy of measurements. They highlighted the importance of data-driven decision making and invited attendees to a side meeting.</li>
<li><strong>SCION Inter-domain Routing Architecture:</strong> Nicola from the SCION Association sought feedback on redefining the space for SCION's work within the IETF.  Deployment experiences and a user perspective from the finance network will be shared at a tomorrow meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Collective Communication Offloading:</strong> Keehan from China Mobile discussed the need for collective communication offloading to improve performance in data center networking and AI training, highlighting issues with bandwidth consumption and data duplication.  A side meeting was announced to discuss potential collaboration within the IETF.</li>
<li><strong>Universal Name System and Certificate Authority:</strong> Proposed a new architecture for identity management and authentication based on random identifiers and confidential computing, aiming to remove privileged insiders and enable cryptographic linking.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-Touch Routing (Kira):</strong> Roland presented Kira, a scalable zero-touch routing protocol aimed at providing resilient autonomous control plane connectivity. He is seeking standardization within the IETF and broader expertise.</li>
<li><strong>IoT Security in the Post-Quantum Era:</strong> Thomas highlighted the challenges of post-quantum cryptography for IoT devices and sought input on potential solutions, including paradigm shifts towards symmetric keys. Also presented JSON Web Token (JWT) revocation mechanisms and whether they could be applied to X509 certificates.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing Post-Quantum Signature Sizes (MTL Mode):</strong> Joe Fuel presented on MTL mode, a method for reducing the impact of post-quantum signature sizes on message series, and announced the release of a reference implementation library.  Feedback on language bindings and crypto libraries was requested.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Digital Agent Protocols:</strong> Adrianne presented remotely on a proposal for a personal digital agent protocol to reverse the trend of platform mediation, emphasizing interoperability and portability of policies.</li>
<li><strong>Secure eduroam Configuration with FIDO Keys:</strong> Janfred from DFN proposed a new method for secure eduroam configuration using FIDO keys to simplify configuration and move away from passwords. Feedback was requested, especially from EAP server operators and FIDO experts.</li>
<li><strong>Ensuring Technology Doesn't Do Certain Things by Design:</strong> Jean Francois sought input on a research group that wants to find a place in IRTF for discussions and research on this topic.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>SCION:</strong> Follow up on identifying a suitable working group or research group to place IETF effort.</li>
<li><strong>IoT Security:</strong> Engage with Thomas to discuss potential solutions for post-quantum cryptography in IoT.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Digital Agent Protocols:</strong> Review the mail list and provide feedback on the proposed standard work group.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Attendees are encouraged to review the drafts mentioned in the presentations and provide feedback to the authors.</li>
<li>Attendees are encouraged to attend the side meetings announced for specific topics.</li>
<li>The presenters will consider the feedback received and revise their proposals as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
