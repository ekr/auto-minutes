## Summary

This LISP working group session in Prague covered several key areas including charter restructuring, reliable transport, EID mobility, P4 implementation, and LISP group mapping. The discussion focused on refining existing drafts, addressing potential issues, and aligning terminology across related documents.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Charter Restructuring:** The updated charter was reviewed, including the scope of the working group and the list of work items and milestones.
*   **Milestones:** A discussion arose regarding the Geo coordinates draft and its readiness for ISG submission. It was agreed to move this milestone forward to March 2024. A general call for broader impact assessments for new document submissions was made.
*   **Historic Documents:** The ID/EID allocation block and allocation guidelines were identified as candidates to be moved to historic status due to lack of use.
*   **Reliable Transport:** The update on map server reliable transport focused on TCP as the primary reliable transport. The discussion included requests for a working group last call and a move to standard track.
*   **EID Mobility:** The presentation on EID mobility highlighted multi-homing support and mechanisms for peer XTR discovery and designated forwarder selection. The importance of split horizon implementation was emphasized.
*   **P4 Implementation:** The P4 implementation presentation showcased high-performance LISP routing capabilities using P4-programmable switches. Evaluations of data rate and controller performance were presented, along with security features.
*   **LISP Group Mapping:** The LISP group mapping draft aimed to formalize terminology for overlay multicast and enable mapping between GEIDs (Group EIDs) and GRLooks (Group RLOCs). Two approaches for GEID to GRLook mapping were discussed: hash-based and mapping system-based. A discussion was had around gaps and what it would do to the group mappings.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Geo Coordinates Draft:** Move the milestone for the Geo coordinates draft to March 2024.
*   **Charter:** Submit the updated charter to Jim for processing with the ISG.
*   **Reliable Transport:** Chairs will provide a review of the reliable transport draft with comments on inconsistencies and missing information. The authors should include text explaining deployment and usage for moving from experimental to standard track.
*   **EID Mobility:** Authors to address split horizon considerations, especially regarding underlay multicast. A full review of the document is expected.
*   **LISP Group Mapping:** Authors to add a pros and cons section regarding the hash-based vs. mapping system-based approaches and potentially express a preference for the latter due to potential collision issues. The LISP chairs proposed to add the proposed terminology updates to all multicast documents.

## Next Steps

*   Chairs to provide reviews and feedback on the Reliable Transport and EID Mobility drafts.
*   Authors of LISP Group Mapping to update the draft with the discussed changes and consider implications of gaps.
*   Working group to consider adoption of the LISP Group Mapping draft.
