# gendispatch

## Summary

The gendispatch session in Prague covered three main topics: removing the expiration date from Internet Drafts, re-licensing RFCs to allow derivative works, and modifying the nomcom appointment structure for greater continuity. There was support for exploring the removal of expiration dates from Internet Drafts, likely through a mini-working group.  The proposal to re-license RFCs to allow derivative works raised significant concerns, especially regarding potential misuse and the IETF's brand. Changes to nomcom appointments did not get consensus.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Internet Draft Expiration:**
    *   The current expiration date doesn't accurately reflect the relevance of drafts and creates unnecessary busywork.
    *   Expiration dates might steer newcomers away from useful but expired drafts.
    *   There's a need for better signals about whether a draft is still active.
    *   The discussion should consider stream specific requirements for individual and independent submission streams.
    *   Existing data tracker functionality for marking drafts as "dead" could be used more effectively.
*   **RFC Re-licensing (Flatware):**
    *   The goal is to allow derivative works based on RFCs, enabling continued maintenance by other entities.
    *   Current licenses are more restrictive than open-source licenses.
    *   Potential for market confusion with forked standards and concern for misuse.
    *   Concerns about IETF branding and the ability to protect its intellectual property.
    *   Existing licenses may not permit derivative works.
    *   The IETF does not currently trademark any protocol names.
    *   Concern raised that changes may facilitate regulators to demand changes based upon illegitimate forks.
    *   The value of the IETF is in its consensus process, not just the documents.
*   **Nomcom Structure:**
    *   The proposal is to create 2-year staggered terms for nomcom members and a 3-year staggered term for the chair.
    *   The current nomcom process can be rushed, leading to less considered appointments.
    *   Concerns regarding reduced randomness and potential for stagnation and reduced diversity.
    *   Potential reduction in volunteer pool.
    *   Greater risk of "stuffing the ballot box."
    *   The complicated system already in use may not be improved through further complexity.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Internet Draft Expiration:** A mini-working group will likely be formed to further investigate and discuss the removal of Internet Draft expiration dates. The AD will be notified of the decision.
*   **RFC Re-licensing:**  Further discussion will be added to the mailing list. Additional work is needed. A non-working group forming BoF was also suggested.
*   **Nomcom Structure:** More clarity is needed, and the proposal is not ready for consideration by the broader IETF. The likely outcome is no action.

## Next Steps

*   **Internet Draft Expiration:** Follow-up on the list to organize a mini-working group.
*   **RFC Re-licensing:** Continue discussion on the mailing list and evaluate if a non working group forming BoF will be scheduled.
*   **Nomcom Structure:** Rick to collect feedback from those interested and possibly organize discussion in future.
