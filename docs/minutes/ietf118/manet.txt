## Summary

The manet working group meeting covered the status of current drafts, presentations on MANET use cases and radio drafts, and a discussion of the working group's charter. The meeting highlighted the need for IPR declarations for some drafts, the importance of running code and experimental data for proposed protocols, and the lack of engagement on the mailing list regarding charter updates.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Draft Status:** Ronald provided an update on the current drafts, mentioning a recent health issue that impacted progress. He also noted the need for IPR declarations from co-authors of certain drafts.
*   **IPR Issues:** Discussion centered on the difficulty of obtaining IPR declarations from unresponsive authors. The AD provided guidance on how to proceed in such cases.
*   **Use Cases and MANET Routing Protocols:** Henning presented on MANET use cases and proposed managed routing protocols, referencing RFC 2501 and suggesting updates to include new technologies.
*   **Running Code and Implementation:** Julius emphasized the importance of having running code and experimental data to validate proposed protocols, citing AODV version 2 as an example of a protocol without sufficient implementation.
*   **Radio Drafts:** Henning presented on radio band, channel utilization, and radio quality drafts, seeking feedback on their adoption.
*   **Charter Discussion:** The group discussed the working group's charter and the need for more active participation on the mailing list. There was limited feedback on the proposed charter updates from the interim meeting.
*   **Multicast Interest:** A poll was conducted to gauge interest in multicast protocols, revealing some interest but also highlighting the dependence of multicast technology on specific use cases.
*   **Satellite Networks:** Discussion briefly touched upon research on routing for satellite networks and its potential relevance to the MANET working group.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Ronald:**
    *   To follow up with the remaining two shepherding write-ups for the drafts.
    *   To push the credit flow control extension to transport area review.
    *   To subject the drafts to routing area review.
    *   Add text to the shepherd write up addressing the attempts to contact authors for IPR declarations.
*   **Lou:**
    *   To attempt to reach out to Bonan Chang regarding the IPR declaration.
    *   To have an offline conversation with the AD/IESG about the David Wiggins IPR issue.
*   **Jim:**
    *   To check with the IESG about the best practice for handling missing IPR declarations.
    *   To review shepherd write up and IPR justification for drafts.
*   **Chairs:**
    *   Restart the charter discussion on the mailing list.
    *   Consider adoption of Henning's radio drafts.
*   **Henning:**
    *   Improve the radio quality draft, focusing on modulation coding scheme and bit error rate.
    *   Potentially create an informational draft on the pros and cons of multicast in MANETs.
*   **Participants:**
    *   Engage in discussions on the mailing list regarding charter updates.
    *   Post on the mailing list about research on satellite network routing.

## Next Steps

*   Ronald to complete the shepherd write-ups and submit drafts for review.
*   Lou to attempt contact with Bonan and discuss the IPR issue with the AD.
*   The chairs will restart the charter discussion on the mailing list and encourage participation.
*   Henning to continue improving the radio drafts based on feedback.
*   All participants are encouraged to engage in discussions on the mailing list.
