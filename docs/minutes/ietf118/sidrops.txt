## Summary

The SIDROPS meeting covered updates on the 8210-bis document, a design analysis of the RPKI prefix list, and a discussion on ROA management. Key concerns were raised about ROA management in dynamic network environments.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **8210-bis Update:** The document was returned to the working group due to references to ASPA. The plan is to finalize ASPA, update 8210-bis accordingly, and then initiate another last call.
*   **RPKI Prefix List Design Analysis:** A presentation covered the design and operational considerations of the RPKI prefix list object.
    *   The intention is to identify invalid routes based on prefixes not included in the list published by the originating AS.
    *   The draft does not clearly state whether more specific prefixes of an included prefix are allowed or disallowed.
    *   The prefix list aims to mitigate AS abuse, route leaks, and reduce the hijacked attack surface.
    *   Operational considerations include prefix splitting and BYOIP customer scenarios.
    *   Discussion on whether the draft should specify that more specific prefixes of an included prefix are considered invalid. A one-to-one mapping between BGP prefixes and enumerated prefixes in the list was favored, mirroring 779 inspired prefix notation.
    *   The meeting also debated the utility of a "not found" state in prefix list verification.
*   **ROA Management:** A presentation detailed concerns about ROA management, particularly in dynamic networks.
    *   The presenters argued that the current ROA management model struggles with route planning, business changes, and resource allocation.
    *   Proposed solutions included finer-grained ROA management at the prefix level, on-demand updates, and bitmap-based encoding.
    *   Concerns were raised about the scalability of single-prefix ROAs.
    *   Existing mechanisms of ROA management was discussed, as it was argued by some that the operational issues presented were resolvable by following correct procedures.
    *   Discussion ensued over the benefits and drawbacks of using bitmap-based encoding compared to existing encoding mechanisms.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **8210-bis:** Update the document after ASPA is finalized and initiate another last call.
*   **RPKI Prefix List:** The working group will consider a separate draft focusing on the solution space, usage recommendations, and operational aspects of the prefix list.
*   **ROA Management:** Discuss examples where the bitmap-based encoding could be useful and also discuss the current mechanisms. The discussion to be had with the presenters.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on ASR and related topics on the mailing list.
*   Explore example implementations of prefix list objects and ROA management using existing mechanisms.
*   Consider potential use cases for bitmap based encoding.
