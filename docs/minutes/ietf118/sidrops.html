<h1>sidrops</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The SIDROPS meeting covered updates on the 8210-bis document, a design analysis of the RPKI prefix list, and a discussion on ROA management. Key concerns were raised about ROA management in dynamic network environments.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>8210-bis Update:</strong> The document was returned to the working group due to references to ASPA. The plan is to finalize ASPA, update 8210-bis accordingly, and then initiate another last call.</li>
<li><strong>RPKI Prefix List Design Analysis:</strong> A presentation covered the design and operational considerations of the RPKI prefix list object.
<ul>
<li>The intention is to identify invalid routes based on prefixes not included in the list published by the originating AS.</li>
<li>The draft does not clearly state whether more specific prefixes of an included prefix are allowed or disallowed.</li>
<li>The prefix list aims to mitigate AS abuse, route leaks, and reduce the hijacked attack surface.</li>
<li>Operational considerations include prefix splitting and BYOIP customer scenarios.</li>
<li>Discussion on whether the draft should specify that more specific prefixes of an included prefix are considered invalid. A one-to-one mapping between BGP prefixes and enumerated prefixes in the list was favored, mirroring 779 inspired prefix notation.</li>
<li>The meeting also debated the utility of a &quot;not found&quot; state in prefix list verification.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ROA Management:</strong> A presentation detailed concerns about ROA management, particularly in dynamic networks.
<ul>
<li>The presenters argued that the current ROA management model struggles with route planning, business changes, and resource allocation.</li>
<li>Proposed solutions included finer-grained ROA management at the prefix level, on-demand updates, and bitmap-based encoding.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about the scalability of single-prefix ROAs.</li>
<li>Existing mechanisms of ROA management was discussed, as it was argued by some that the operational issues presented were resolvable by following correct procedures.</li>
<li>Discussion ensued over the benefits and drawbacks of using bitmap-based encoding compared to existing encoding mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>8210-bis:</strong> Update the document after ASPA is finalized and initiate another last call.</li>
<li><strong>RPKI Prefix List:</strong> The working group will consider a separate draft focusing on the solution space, usage recommendations, and operational aspects of the prefix list.</li>
<li><strong>ROA Management:</strong> Discuss examples where the bitmap-based encoding could be useful and also discuss the current mechanisms. The discussion to be had with the presenters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussions on ASR and related topics on the mailing list.</li>
<li>Explore example implementations of prefix list objects and ROA management using existing mechanisms.</li>
<li>Consider potential use cases for bitmap based encoding.</li>
</ul>
