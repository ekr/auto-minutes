## Summary

The rasprg meeting covered a diverse range of topics related to the analysis of standardization processes. Presentations included an overview of the Internet Standard Tracker, updates on the Big Bang project, an analysis of consensus decision-making within the IESG, a study of communication patterns in the IETF, and a discussion on the relationship between CDNs and states. Each presentation was followed by a Q&A session, fostering discussion and collaboration among attendees.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Internet Standard Tracker (Carolina Payro & Nathan Allen, DNS Research Federation):**
    *   Presentation of the Internet Standard Tracker, a tool for monitoring standards under development in ITU, with future plans for IETF and ETSI.
    *   Discussion of the tracker's backend analytics platform, including data ingestion, keyword analysis, and scoring systems.
    *   Questions about the tracker's methodology, potential biases, and its applicability to other SDOs and civil society.
*   **Big Bang Update (Sebastian Bentall):**
    *   Update on the Big Bang project, an open-source tool for analyzing data from SDOs.
    *   Focus on mapping the dominance of particular actors (individuals and organizations) in standards development.
    *   Discussion of improvements to data ingest, new analysis notebooks, and plans to ingest data from W3C.
*   **Consensus Decision Making in the IESG (Susan Hairs):**
    *   Presentation of a mixed-methods study analyzing the ISG's decision-making process.
    *   Finding that the time to get through the ISG depends on the decisions they make. And the quality of those decisions.
    *   Analysis of factors influencing ISG effectiveness, including collaboration, solidarity, and conflict.
    *   Discussion on the importance of data quality and triangulation in understanding the IESG process.
*   **Communication Patterns in the IETF (Matthew Russell Barnes, Queen Mary University):**
    *   Analysis of communication patterns in the IETF mailing lists using social graph analysis.
    *   Exploration of how the IETF's hierarchical structure affects communication, focusing on the roles of regular participants, working group chairs, and area directors.
    *   Finding that Working Group chairs are discussion facilitators and Area Directors condense information.
    *   Discussion on the implications of declining mailing list activity and the increasing use of platforms like GitHub.
*   **CDNs and States (Nick Merrill, UC Berkeley Center for Long cybersecurity):**
    *   Examination of the relationship between Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and states, focusing on issues of internet sovereignty and censorship.
    *   Discussion of potential conflicts between state interests and CDN operations, particularly in the context of denying internet access.
    *   Exploration of how to promote a better understanding of CDN interests to mitigate potential conflicts.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   Sebastian Bentall to share details of the Big Bang project with the rasprg mailing list, so that interested individuals can review and provide feedback.

## Next Steps

*   Carolina Payro and Nathan Allen to consider the feedback received regarding the Internet Standard Tracker's methodology, biases, and potential for collaboration with other stakeholders.
*   Matthew Russell Barnes to explore the potential for incorporating data from GitHub and other platforms into the analysis of IETF communication patterns.
*   Nick Merrill to continue research on the relationship between CDNs and states, with a focus on understanding CDN interests and identifying potential areas of conflict and collaboration.
