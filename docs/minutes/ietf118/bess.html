<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 06 Nov 2023 12:00</p>
<h1>bess</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The BESS working group meeting covered a range of topics related to EVPN, BGP, and related technologies. Presentations included updates on existing drafts, discussions of new proposals, and considerations for deployment and interoperation. Key themes included multi-site EVPN, source address validation, and the potential for &quot;BGP Attribute Escape.&quot; Several documents are nearing working group last call.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>EVPN-MVPN Interop Draft:</strong> Discussion focused on alignment with RFC 6513/6514 regarding multi-homing and the handling of different route types.</li>
<li><strong>V4V6 PE Only Stacking:</strong> Update on the draft combining previous efforts and providing parity between IPv4 and IPv6-only peering designs.</li>
<li><strong>BGP Attribute Escape:</strong> Detailed presentation highlighting the risks of path attributes being propagated beyond their intended scope, causing potential forwarding problems, session resets, and security vulnerabilities. Raised the need for better filtering and scoping mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Site EVPN Draft:</strong> Compared with RFC 9014, with a focus on the benefits of Anycast VTEP and simplified control plane scaling. The deltas versus the existing RFCs was questioned.</li>
<li><strong>Centralized Anycast Gateway Draft:</strong> Discussion of architecture and procedures for a centralized anycast gateway model.</li>
<li><strong>Savi and EVPN Integration:</strong> Discussion on the interaction and integration between SAVI (Source Address Validation) and EVPN, including the tradeoffs and potential optimizations.</li>
<li><strong>L3 Optimized IRB:</strong> Presentation on a solution for L3 optimization of IRB (Integrated Routing and Bridging), including potential caveats and operational concerns and if this was a solution looking for a problem.</li>
<li><strong>Private Line Emulation:</strong> Update on the signaling of TDM pseudo-wires over packet networks, including proposals for extending EVPN VPWS.</li>
<li><strong>Map SAFI Draft:</strong> Discussion about the integration of Mobile User plane with a service 6 data plane.</li>
<li><strong>SRV6 Flag Extension for Multi-homing:</strong> Presentation on new flags for SRV6 service seeds in multi-homing scenarios, aimed at improving FRR and load balancing.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified MVPN for Beer and English Replication:</strong> Discussion about simplifying MVP architecture and procedures of I2S.</li>
<li><strong>EL3 Multihoming Draft:</strong> Discussed how to support load balancing and provide synchronization of ART tables when using EVPN multi homing with L3 interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>LSP Ping:</strong> Andrew confirmed he had sent the LSP ping document to Ayanna.</li>
<li><strong>SD-WAN Usage Draft:</strong> The group will readopt the document due to a restrictive copyright clause.</li>
<li><strong>EVPN and BFT Draft:</strong> Add this to the queue for Working Group Last Call.</li>
<li>Authors were asked to incorporate the comments made and send replies and additional comments to the relevant mailing lists.</li>
<li>Working group chairs will consider documents for adoption and last call.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to update drafts based on the feedback received during the meeting and on the mailing list.</li>
<li>Chairs to review adoption queue and initiate adoption polls.</li>
<li>Further discussion on the mailing lists regarding technical details and implementation considerations.</li>
</ul>
