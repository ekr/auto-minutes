## Summary

The DHCP working group meeting at IETF 115 covered the advancement of DHCPv6 to an Internet Standard, specifically focusing on 8415bis, SRv6 locator distribution via DHCP, and registering self-generated IPv6 addresses.  The meeting addressed errata, discussed the removal of deprecated features, and explored new functionalities for DHCPv6.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **8415bis (DHCPv6 Internet Standard):**
    *   Addressed all errata and removed iATAs and the server unicast option.
    *   Discussion on removing background material and text related to unicast transmissions.
    *   Seeking working group adoption and reviewers.  Suresh volunteered to shepherd the document.
*   **SRv6 Locator Distribution via DHCP:**
    *   Presented an updated draft introducing a new IA option for SRv6 locators.
    *   Discussed the need to coordinate with the SPRING working group.
    *   Consideration needed for scenarios with multiple server responses.
*   **Registering Self-Generated IPv6 Addresses:**
    *   Clarified the sending and receiving of registration messages, including address validation.
    *   Discussion on the retransmission strategy and whether to use standard DHCP retransmission logic.
    *   Debate on whether the DHCP server should mark registered addresses as unavailable.
    *   Discussion around unicast vs multicast usage.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **8415bis:**
    *   Remove background material, unicast-related text, and deprecate the multicast status code.
    *   Publish 01 version incorporating IANA feedback and working group adoption feedback.
    *   **ACTION:** Participants to review and provide feedback on the document during the adoption call.
*   **SRv6 Locator Distribution via DHCP:**
    *   **ACTION:** Authors to engage with the SPRING working group to gauge interest and coordinate efforts.
    *   **ACTION:** Authors to add text describing behavior when multiple servers respond.
*   **Registering Self-Generated IPv6 Addresses:**
    *   **ACTION:** Working Group to respond with interest in adopting the document
    *   **ACTION:** Authors to consider:
        *   Including acknowledgment messages
        *   Potentially switching to TCP for communication and potentially replacing registration messages with an info request
        *   Whether the DHCP server should mark registered addresses as unavailable or delete the records on "release"
        *   Whether switches can send the message on behalf of clients

## Next Steps

*   Initiate working group adoption calls for both the 8415bis and the IPv6 address registration drafts on the mailing list.
*   Authors to revise their respective drafts based on the feedback received during the meeting.
*   Coordinate with the SPRING working group regarding the SRv6 locator distribution draft.
