## Summary

The DNSOP working group meeting at IETF 115 covered document updates, ongoing work, the hackathon update, and presentations on various topics, including all TLD, DNS error reporting, caching resolution failures, rights, and structured data for filter DNS. Key discussion points involved the status of specific drafts, the need for more working group participation in document review, and proposals for new work adoption.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Updates:** Status of various drafts was discussed, including 5933bis, catalog zones, avoid fragmentation, service B, and DNS type BCT.
*   **Validator Requirements:**  The need for more comments from the working group to move validator requirements document along was emphasized.
*   **all TLD Draft:** Discussion focused on whether resolvers should treat `.alt` specially and whether to redesign the draft to use as112.
*   **DNS Error Reporting:** Presentation on the hackathon results, improvements, and implementations of DNS error reporting. Discussion on handling validators behind forwarders.
*   **Caching Resolution Failures:** Discussion on rephrasing requirements, protecting against attacks, timing, and whether to partition the cache by edns client subnet values.
*   **Rights:** Concerns about the complexity of name resolution with multiple transports and protocols, and a proposal for a new EDNS option to allow stub resolvers to communicate their preferences to local proxies.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item (Chairs):** Send validator requirements to the DNS Directorate for an early review.
*   **Action Item (Authors):** Address Brian's comment on the validator requirements draft.
*   **Action Item (Authors - Roy Adams):** Add language to the DNS Error Reporting draft regarding forwarders.
*   **Decision:** Move all TLD draft to working group last call if no new concerns arise after the current discussion.
*   **Action Item (Peter Thomason):** Read csync RFC section 4.2 regarding server consistency.
*   **Action Item (Authors - Thiru):** Schedule working group adoption call for Structured Data for Filter DNS.
*   **Action Item (Philip Humberg):** Bring "rights" discussion to mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on all TLD draft issues (resolver behavior and as112) on the mailing list.
*   Address feedback and questions from the working group on presented drafts.
*   Prepare for working group last call for drafts nearing completion.
*   Further explore possible candidates for adoption.
