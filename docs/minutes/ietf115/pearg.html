<h1>pearg</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The PEARG session covered updates on its current drafts, including two drafts nearing publication on Transient Numeric Identifiers (TNI) and one on a survey of censorship techniques. Discussions were held on ongoing drafts for safe measurement guidelines and IP address privacy considerations. Three presentations followed: &quot;Clean Insights&quot; (David Oliver) explored privacy-preserving measurement strategies for civil society, emphasizing user consent and transparent data collection; &quot;Practically Exploitable Cryptographic Vulnerabilities in Matrix&quot; (Sofia Celi &amp; Daniel Jones) detailed several critical vulnerabilities found in the Matrix messaging protocol related to authentication, impersonation, and key backups; and &quot;Measurements of Internet Censorship Globally&quot; (Simone Basso - OONI) showcased OONI's methodology and recent findings on internet censorship in Iran, Russia, and the status of HTTP/3 and DNS-over-HTTPS/TLS. Key themes included the challenges of balancing data collection with privacy, the complexity of secure messaging protocols, and the evolving landscape of internet censorship.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draft Updates:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transient Numeric Identifiers (TNI):</strong> Two drafts are in their final stages of review, with publication anticipated soon, marking the first documents from PEARG.</li>
<li><strong>Survey of Worldwide Censorship Techniques:</strong> Passed IRTF last call and is undergoing review by the IRTF Chair.</li>
<li><strong>Guidelines for Performing Safe Measurement on the Internet:</strong> Recently updated (August 2023), considered in good shape but requires more community review. Mentioned at an IAB workshop on encrypted network measurement, highlighting its unique holistic harm reduction approach.</li>
<li><strong>IP Address Privacy Considerations:</strong> Received a recent update. Authors plan an editorial pass before IETF 116 and are seeking community review, particularly regarding applications and use cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Clean Insights&quot; Presentation (David Oliver):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Started in 2017 to address privacy-preserving measurement needs for civil society, internet freedom, and human rights, pre-GDPR enforcement.</li>
<li><strong>Approach:</strong> Focuses on collecting &quot;just enough data&quot; to answer specific questions, aggregating on the source, using an anonymizing proxy, and ensuring transparent user engagement and consent.</li>
<li><strong>Technology:</strong> Provides SDKs for clients/servers, an anonymizing proxy (integrates with Matomo, extensible to other analytics), and domain fronting capabilities for censorship/surveillance resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Principles:</strong> Emphasizes time-bound &quot;campaigns&quot; for data collection and avoids &quot;contracts of adhesion&quot; where users feel compelled to consent.</li>
<li><strong>Consent Models:</strong> Explored design patterns for consent, such as &quot;umbrella app&quot; (patterns of usage) and &quot;focus group&quot; (selective user base).</li>
<li><strong>Relation to IETF PPM:</strong> Shares common ground on the need for proxying and starting with specific questions. Differs in its lightweight implementation and reliance on &quot;trust in the collector and implementers&quot; for defining and neutralizing &quot;toxic&quot; PII, rather than hard protocol enforcement. It maintains concern for one-time visit anonymity.</li>
<li><strong>Q&amp;A Highlights:</strong> Discussion included the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; (not explicitly in CI, but campaigns offer a partial mechanism), the broader issue of diluted consent in current internet practices (CI aims for real consent at a smaller scale), and exploring cryptographic methods to reduce collector trust (e.g., Oblivious HTTP, algorithmic privacy measures) as future work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Practically Exploitable Cryptographic Vulnerabilities in Matrix&quot; Presentation (Sofia Celi &amp; Daniel Jones):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> Matrix is a widely used (60M+ users) decentralized messaging protocol aiming for secure communication with untrusted home servers and end-to-end encryption. Claims properties like confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and deniability.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability 1: Home Server control of users/devices (Confidentiality/Integrity/Authentication Break):</strong> Group membership messages are unencrypted and unauthenticated, allowing a malicious Home Server to inject users or devices into a room, enabling decryption of future messages.
<ul>
<li><strong>Root Cause:</strong> Assumption that only user messages need protection; practical implementation challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Cryptographically authenticated device lists (already present for cross-signing, but not for the HS's device list).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability 2: Short Authentication String (SAS) Protocol Verification (Authentication Break):</strong> Lack of domain separation in key identifiers allows a Home Server to provide its own device identifier, which is interpreted as a master cross-signing key fingerprint during out-of-band verification, leading to impersonation.
<ul>
<li><strong>Root Cause:</strong> Using the same field for device identifiers (server-controlled) and master cross-signing key fingerprints (user-controlled).</li>
<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Avoid server-controlled inputs in out-of-band verification protocols.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability 3: Semi-Trusted Impersonation (Authentication Break):</strong> The key request protocol (for new devices to decrypt old messages) lacked sufficient receiving-side checks. A Home Server could force-send a &quot;forwarded room key message&quot; to impersonate another device.
<ul>
<li><strong>Root Cause:</strong> Implementation mistake and underspecified protocol for handling forwarded keys. Keys received this way are flagged as &quot;semi-trusted&quot; in the UI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability 4: Upgrading Impersonation:</strong> Building on V3, an adversary could send new Megolm session setup messages over the semi-trusted channel, leading to a &quot;fully trusted&quot; impersonation that bypasses UI warnings.
<ul>
<li><strong>Root Cause:</strong> Implementation mistake, protocol confusion where session setup messages were incorrectly allowed over Megolm.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability 5: Confidentiality Break via Key Backup:</strong> Combining V3 and V4, an adversary could impersonate a trusted device and use the Secure Storage/Secret Sharing protocol to force a target device to use a Home Server-controlled recovery key for Megolm key backups, enabling the HS to decrypt all messages.
<ul>
<li><strong>Root Cause:</strong> Implementation mistake, protocol confusion, and flexible specification for encryption algorithms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> The vulnerabilities are practically exploitable. The complexity of secure group messaging protocols and unclear security properties highlight the need for formal modeling, analysis, and cross-community collaboration (academic, standardization bodies).</li>
<li><strong>Q&amp;A Highlights:</strong> Discussions touched on federation between home servers (modeled as a single untrusted entity for current analysis), plans for a &quot;part two&quot; focusing on formal modeling and deniability properties, and the importance of collaboration with IETF working groups like MIMI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Measurements of Internet Censorship Globally&quot; Presentation (Simone Basso - OONI):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>OONI Overview:</strong> A free software project (since 2012) providing tools for users to measure internet censorship, accumulating over a billion measurements from 200+ countries.</li>
<li><strong>Measurement Principles:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Probes are provided with known-good IP addresses and contextual information for targets.</li>
<li>DNS lookups include both the ISP's resolver and unencrypted DNS over UDP 53 to detect blanket interception.</li>
<li>HTTPS measurements involve TCP connect, TLS handshake, and resource fetch, with failures indicating &quot;anomalies.&quot;</li>
<li>A backend organizes data, and OONI Explorer/reports make findings accessible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Case Study: Iran (Mahsa Amini protests, September 2022):</strong> Observed a shift from &quot;anomaly&quot; to &quot;confirmed&quot; censorship (e.g., using Bogon IPs) for DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH). Detailed analysis showed mixed blocking patterns (DNS blocking, TCP connect timeouts, TLS handshake timeouts), with some good IPs still working, suggesting dynamic and IP-dependent blocking.</li>
<li><strong>Case Study: Russia (early 2022):</strong> Detected throttling of Twitter by analyzing TLS handshake times and data received. Identified two populations of users: normal speed and very slow handshakes, indicating &quot;heavy throttling&quot; aimed at disrupting application usability.</li>
<li><strong>Case Study: Quick/HTTP/3 Measurements:</strong> Experimental measurements from China indicated that many sites blocked via HTTPS (TCP/TLS) were also blocked for HTTP/3, suggesting IP/endpoint blocking. However, some sites inaccessible over HTTPS were working via HTTP/3. An experimental &quot;Quick Ping&quot; tool suggested that observed timeouts were for basic Quick connectivity, not necessarily TLS inspection within Quick at the time.</li>
<li><strong>DNS Track Experiment:</strong> A new OONI Probe experiment dedicated to measuring DoT/DoH, following OONI's core principles. Data is starting to be collected.</li>
<li><strong>Future Work:</strong> Improving data anonymization and accessibility, adding DoH3/DoQ support, using Chrome's TLS fingerprint to avoid confounding factors, and integrating Quick measurements into mainline experiments.</li>
<li><strong>Q&amp;A Highlights:</strong> Discussion included differentiating between government censorship and cloud provider blocking (OONI can detect 403 responses but not the direct cause); extending the Quick Ping tool to account for middleboxes that inspect specific offsets for SNI within Quick; and OONI's approach to responsible measurement, including detailed consent documentation, in-app quizzes to confirm user understanding, and a separate &quot;experimental&quot; client for advanced users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
