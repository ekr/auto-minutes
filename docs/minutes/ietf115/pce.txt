# pce

## Summary

The pce working group session at IETF 115 covered working group document status, early reviews, and focused on various drafts related to PCE extensions for technologies like TLS 1.3, Miro Binding, iFit, controlled ID space, and IP/VPN tunnels. Discussions involved potential adoption of drafts, feedback on existing proposals, and considerations for coordination with other working groups.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **TLS 1.3 Support (draft-ietf-pce-pcep-tls13):**  Discussion on adopting the draft. It addresses the use of TLS 1.3 with PCEP, specifically profiling the protocol and avoiding replayable modes. The Netconf working group has aligned with the draft's recommendations.
*   **Miro Binding (draft-xxx-pce-binding-protection):** Presents a pce extension for Miro binding and protection, specifically the use of binding seeds.  Andrew provided feedback and raised concerns about the solution's complexity, hardware capability assumptions, and alignment with other routing mechanisms (e.g., Spring). Suggestion to move the core work to Spring or a routing WG.
*   **iFit (draft-ietf-pce-ifit-pm):** Update on the draft. iFit Telemetry in data plane. PSAP extension to distribute paths carrying iFit info. Clarification and updates based on feedback received to include supported methods of ifit specifically srv6.
*   **Controlled ID Space (draft-han-pce-id-space):** Discussion on draft adoption. Proposes a mechanism to advertise ID space to PC peers to control label range allocation. Expanded to various functional IDs and added the C structure to describe the seed.
*   **PCE Initiated IP Tunnel (draft-xxx-pce-ip-tunnel):** Presents a draft for initiating IP tunnels using PCEP. Andrew questioned the necessity of using PCEP versus other configuration protocols. Justification for using pce discussed around te metric requirements. Feedback requested on the types of tunnels supported and whether to include state synchronization. Concerns about motivation and choice of using PCEP.
*   **Working Group Document Status:**  Review of various working group documents including the YANG model, SRv6 binding set document, Native IP, Flexgrid, Enhanced Error. Discussed documents nearing working group last call and those requiring updates. Mentioned documents blocked in the RFC editor queue.
*   **Coordination with Other Working Groups:**  Importance of coordination with other groups (BEER, DETNET, etc.) was highlighted to avoid duplicated effort or conflicting mechanisms. A Wiki page has been created to track coordination efforts.
*   **BFD Enablement:** Discussion on enabling BFD with PCE. Awaiting an internet draft to facilitate discussion.
*   **PC Operational Draft:**  Decision to split the PC operational draft into a standards-track document and an informational document for more clarity and easier progression through the IESG.
*   **Early Reviews:** Use of early reviews from the routing area.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **draft-ietf-pce-pcep-tls13:**  Chairs will send a question to the mailing list about the adoption of this draft.
*   **draft-xxx-pce-binding-protection:** Authors to consider reframing as a mechanism with common applicability, potentially moving the core aspects of the draft to Spring or a routing WG before addressing PCEP-specific encodings.
*   **draft-han-pce-id-space:** Chairs to progress the adoption of the draft.
*   **draft-xxx-pce-ip-tunnel:** Authors to better motivate the use of PCEP for IP tunnel initiation within the draft. Authors should consider reusing existing message structure. Working group to reach consensus if sufficient motivation to proceed.
*   **Enhanced Error (draft-xxx-pce-enhanced-error):** The WG to make a decision regarding the progress of this document.
*   **Wiki Updates:** Authors of drafts interacting with other WGs to update the coordination wiki.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on the mailing list for all drafts presented.
*   Authors to address feedback provided during the meeting.
*   Chairs to initiate adoption calls where appropriate.
