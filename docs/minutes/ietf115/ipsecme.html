<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 09 Nov 2022 15:00</p>
<h1>ipsecme</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The ipsecme working group session discussed the status of various drafts, several new proposals, and challenges in scaling IPSec deployments. Key topics included the adoption of optimized multi-child SA rekeying, issues with IKEv2 payload size limits and cookie processing, source address validation using RPKI and IPSec, and a proposal for anti-replay subspaces to improve performance in multi-core and multi-path environments. The session highlighted a clear interest in addressing scalability and performance for large-scale IPSec deployments, particularly in the context of emerging post-quantum cryptography and 5G use cases.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Draft Status Update:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Four drafts are in the RFC Editor queue.</li>
<li>Two documents are in IETF/WG Last Call, with reminders for shepherd review (IKEv2) and additional reviews (P2).</li>
<li>IKEv2-no-ids was noted as ready for Working Group Last Call.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple Child SAs (draft-wouters-ipsecme-multiple-sas):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The latest version removes the &quot;special fallback SA,&quot; making it an implementation-specific functionality.</li>
<li>Discussion on scalability concerns for large IPSec hubs with many SAs; the expected use case focuses on filling CPU capacity rather than excessive SA multiplication per tunnel.</li>
<li>Support for adoption as a starting point, with calls to potentially limit SA creation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IPSec Workshop Report:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FIPS requirements for AES-GCM:</strong> Clarified that the same key can be used for more than 2^32 packets in FIPS mode if IV/ICV is greater than 8 octets.</li>
<li><strong>Decoupled Policies:</strong> Flat SPD data structures improve lookup efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Full Hardware Offload for IPSec:</strong> APIs exist for Linux, supported by Melanox Nvidia CX-7 cards, enabling full IPSec data path in hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Forwarding Fast Path (Linux):</strong> Packet parking, using netfilter flow tables and small code loops, showed a 5x performance boost.</li>
<li><strong>ANEMA and IPSec:</strong> Problem with VTI interfaces for network name status; XFRM interfaces were proposed as a solution.</li>
<li><strong>IPTFS:</strong> Aggregation and fragmentation are supported, but constant rate sending is still missing.</li>
<li><strong>Re-thinking ESP:</strong> Extensive discussion around multi-CPU, QoS, hardware flows, and anti-replay windows, potentially leading to an &quot;ESPv4&quot; due to limitations and new protocols like PLP Crypto.</li>
<li><strong>Beat Mode:</strong> Despite being an old, unfinished draft (2008), it's implemented in Linux and widely used; a consensus to continue its work towards a Proposed Standard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IPComp Extension (draft-hu-ipsecme-ipcomp-extension):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed extensions to address IPComp issues:
<ol>
<li><strong>Incompatibility with network functions:</strong> Transport layer (L4) information (ports) is compressed, hindering firewalls/NAT. Solutions proposed: new flag or duplicate CPI code points.</li>
<li><strong>Out-of-order processing:</strong> Uncompressed packets sent without an IPComp header are processed differently. Proposed solution: always send IPComp header with a new CPI for uncompressed packets.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Discussion also touched on decoupling IPComp from IPSec, as its issues are not security-related.</li>
<li>The working group suggested exploring existing alternatives like IPTFS, CHIC over IP, or DIET-ESP for compression and MTU issues, indicating low interest in extending IPComp within ipsecme.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New IKEv2 Payload Formats (draft-valerie-ipsecme-compact-ikev2-payloads-format, draft-wouters-ikev2-large-payloads):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Current IKEv2 payload length (2 bytes) limits payloads to 64KB, problematic for Post-Quantum (PQ) algorithms with large public keys and signatures (e.g., Classic McEliece).</li>
<li>Existing formats also exhibit redundancy (reserved fields, fixed-size parameters).</li>
<li>Proposals address either the 64KB limit or redundancy, with different negotiation and implementation complexities.</li>
<li>Working group expressed interest in a single, generic solution for the &gt;64KB limit, with redundancy reduction being a separate, though related, concern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IKEv2 Cookie Rework (draft-valerie-ikev2-revised-cookie-processing):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identified a protocol flaw where packet loss/reordering or a responder changing its secret key can cause <code>IKE_SA_INIT</code> authentication failures due to differing views of the most recent request used in calculation.</li>
<li>Proposed a &quot;revised cookie processing&quot; that excludes the cookie notify payload from authentication calculation, negotiated via a new notify message.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about modifying the authentication system for a non-security-critical error, with suggestions for less intrusive solutions like the initiator echoing the cookie in <code>IKE_AUTH</code> for verification by the responder, leading to an error message if there's a mismatch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Receive RPKI and IPSec AS2AS Approach for Source Address Validation (rSAV) (draft-li-ipsecme-rsav):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proposal for a cryptographically based inter-AS Source Address Validation (SAV) protocol using RPKI for prefix origin authorization and IPSec (rSAV AH in transport mode) for IP source address authentication.</li>
<li>Key features: RPKI integration, AS Contact Servers (ACS) for IKEv2 negotiation, rSAV announcement in RPKI, and IPSec SA indexed by SPI and AS number.</li>
<li>Discussion touched on specific IPSec protocol details, such as the use of <code>DELETE</code> notifications for rejection, the role of ICV in ESP, and the negotiation of transport vs. tunnel mode.</li>
<li>A warning was raised against using Static Diffie-Hellman due to the lack of Post-Quantum equivalents.</li>
<li>The proposal is in early stages, focusing on addressing large-scale IPSec mesh deployments and minimizing state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimized IKEv2 Rekeying (draft-li-ipsecme-optimized-rekeying):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Leverages RFC 7296 (section 2.8) to omit Traffic Selector (TS) and Security Association (SA) payloads during rekeying <em>for child SAs</em> if they are unchanged. This saves bandwidth and CPU cycles.</li>
<li>Implementation in 5G base stations reported, demonstrating practical value for large-scale, low-power, and constrained environments.</li>
<li>Clarification: This optimization primarily applies to child SAs, not IKE SAs, as IKE SAs can have different algorithms during rekeying.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IPSec Anti-Replay Subspaces (draft-thompson-ipsecme-anti-replay-subspaces):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Addresses performance challenges in multi-core, multi-path IPSec hubs handling thousands of peers. Current approach of using many child SAs (e.g., 4M for 6 paths/6 QoS classes) leads to high IKE negotiation load and memory issues.</li>
<li>Proposal: Introduce multiple anti-replay windows within a single child SA, distinguished by a &quot;Subspace ID&quot; in the ESP header.</li>
<li>Discussion points include IKE negotiation mechanisms, where to embed the Subspace ID in the ESP header (e.g., explicit extended sequence number field), and FIPS compliance for AES-GCM nonces.</li>
<li>The working group acknowledged the problem, with some suggesting that separate SAs are the existing solution, while others highlighted the scalability issues of that approach in large-scale deployments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple Child SAs (draft-wouters-ipsecme-multiple-sas):</strong> A working group adoption call will be issued.</li>
<li><strong>New IKEv2 Payload Formats:</strong> Valerie to draft a combined solution addressing both the &gt;64KB payload size limit and message redundancy.</li>
