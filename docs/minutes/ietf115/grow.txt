## Summary

The grow working group session at IETF 115 in London focused primarily on BMP and a novel proposal for describing BGP communities in JSON format.  Discussions included updates on BMP TLV, Ebit progress, BMP High Availability data collection, the BGP Young model, BMP path marking, and the JSON community description proposal. Several questions were raised, feedback was provided, and next steps were identified for the discussed topics.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **BMP TLV:** Discussion centered on updates to the BMP TLV draft, including consistency with root mirroring messages and the introduction of the group TLV. Feedback from Tim Evans is still being processed.
*   **BMP Ebit:** The Ebit draft was adopted by the working group with minor updates. The applicability of the Ebit to the stats message was discussed, with a request for feedback.
*   **BMP Event Logging:** A new message type for event-driven routing events in BMP was presented. The proposal involves a TLV-based message body consistent with root mirroring. Concerns were raised about overloading the BMP protocol and whether alerting should be integrated into routers.
*   **BMP High Availability Data Collection:**  A project focused on ensuring BMP data high availability and load balancing using multiple collectors and redis.  The discussion highlighted the challenges of ensuring data consistency between collectors due to BGP route update order variations.
*   **BGP Young Model:** Updates were provided, noting Tom Patch's contributions and the addition of an initial delay for backoff timers. Integration with a routing policy model for sending specific prefixes to the BMP station was discussed.
*   **BMP Path Marking:** Updates were provided on a draft focused on path status TLV for BMP messages, including examples of path statuses. This allows the sending device to expose its view on the forwarding state of paths.
*   **BGP Communities in JSON:** A proposal to define BGP communities in JSON format for standardized publication and tool usage was introduced. Various suggestions were given including using existing XML definitions from the IANA registry, considerations for using regular expressions, standardizing new BGP communities, and how to discover the list.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **BMP TLV:** Paolo will process feedback from Tim Evans and incorporate changes into the next version of the draft.
*   **BMP Ebit:** Feedback is requested on whether the Ebit should apply to the stats message.
*   **BGP Young Model:** Camilo will double-check the status of the adoption call.
*   **BGP Communities in JSON:** Martin was encouraged to write an internet draft and submit it to the working group for consideration.

## Next Steps

*   Continue work on BMP TLV, Ebit, BGP Young Model, and BMP path marking drafts based on feedback received.
*   Explore potential collaboration on the BGP communities in JSON proposal, considering various suggestions for implementation and standardization.
*   A working group adoption call related to the EGP well-known Community for anycast will be open for another week.
