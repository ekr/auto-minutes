## Summary

This emailcore session focused on several key issues, including the Trace header field syntax, registry for Trace header fields, IANA registration procedures for SMTP extensions, and recent changes to related drafts.  The discussion centered around resolving ambiguities and inconsistencies in existing specifications and determining the appropriate level of restrictiveness for the Trace header field syntax. Decisions were made regarding the Trace header field syntax, and action items were assigned to address specific issues. The group agreed to hold an interim meeting in early December.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Trace Header Field Syntax (5321 vs. 5322):**  Discussed several options for reconciling the differing syntaxes for the Trace header field in RFC 5321 and RFC 5322.  Options ranged from leaving the syntax as is with a clarifying comment, to removing the ABNF from 5322 and referencing 5321, to making it completely unstructured in 5322 and deferring to 5321.
*   **Registry for Trace Header Fields:**  The need for a registry specific to Trace header fields was discussed.  Alternatives included creating a new registry, adding a column to the existing message header field registry, or adding comments to the existing registry.  The implications for MUAs needing to strip these headers were considered.
*   **IANA Registration Procedures for SMTP Extensions:** Explored the current IANA registration procedures for SMTP extensions. John Levine proposed a new approach dividing the registry into "reviewed by the IETF" and "other registrations."
*   **Recent Changes to Drafts:** Ken Murchison presented recent updates to various drafts, including introduction text, security considerations, text on case sensitivity, and an acknowledgment section.
*   **Email Addresses in Forums:** The issue of percent encoding in known Gmail addresses was discussed, and whether to include text discouraging this practice in the relevant specifications.
*   **Referencing HTML for `addr-spec`:**  Discussed the current practice of referencing an HTML document for the `addr-spec` ABNF and its potential downsides due to lack of control over the HTML document's definition.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Trace Header Field Syntax:** The group weakly prefers no syntax change in 5322, but adding a comment to the ABNF referencing 5321. The editors of RFC 5321 and RFC 5322 (Pete and John Clemson) will collaborate to propose the clarifying text to the mailing list.
*   **Trace Header Field Registry:** The group decided *against* creating a new registry for trace header fields. A new column should be added to the existing message header field registry.
*   **IANA Registration Procedures for SMTP Extensions:** John Levine and Alexei Melnikov will collaborate on text to divide the registry into two sections: "reviewed by the IETF" and "other registrations."
*   **Email Addresses in Forums:** Barry Leiba will draft text stating that percent encoded Gmail addresses should not be supported.
*   **Referencing HTML for `addr-spec`:** John Levine and John Klensin will write text addressing the HTML reference for `addr-spec`, contact the relevant web standards body, and provide a recommendation for handling the issue.
* Ken will review the latest draft and comment on this issue.

## Next Steps

*   The editors of RFC 5321 and RFC 5322 will propose text for the Trace header field syntax clarification to the mailing list.
*   John Levine and Alexei Melnikov will propose updated text for the SMTP extension IANA registration procedures to the mailing list.
*   Barry Leiba will draft text regarding percent encoded Gmail addresses.
* John Levine and John Klensin will write text addressing the HTML reference for `addr-spec`.
*   Hold an interim meeting in early December to further discuss and resolve open issues.
* The working group should review the new drafts once the action items have been addressed, and provide feedback via the mailing list.
