# v6ops

## Summary

The v6ops meeting covered a range of IPv6 related topics, including working group status, discussion of an ND optimization draft, an IPv6-only multi-domain framework, extension header testing, IPv6 only iterative resolvers, hard-coded limits on IPv6 addresses per MAC, and IPv6 only hosting experiences.  Discussions included potential adoption calls, methodologies for testing, and areas for future work.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Working Group Status:** The group is growing in membership but needs to focus on quality and impact, potentially by creating summary drafts on frequently debated topics.
*   **ND Optimization Draft:** The draft summarizes node issues and proposes host isolation as a solution.  Changes in the latest version addressed comments from the previous IETF.
*   **IPv6-Only Multi-Domain Framework:** A draft proposing a framework for end-to-end IPv4 service delivery across IPv6-only networks. The proposal includes address mapping rules propagated via routing.
*   **Extension Header Testing:** A set of drafts discussing topologies and methodologies for troubleshooting IPv6 extension header packet drops. The team tests different topologies (naked server, CDN, cloud providers) and uses both real data and crafted packets.
*   **IPv6 Only Iterative Resolvers:** Discussed the usefulness of running IPv6 only DNS resolvers by doing IPv4 to IPv6 translation in the application.
*   **Hard-coded Limits on IPv6 Addresses per MAC:** Discussed the problems that come with having hard-coded limits on IPv6 addresses per MAC in layer 2 devices, including silent failures and troubleshooting difficulties.  A potential long-term solution using /64 prefix delegation per host was introduced.
*   **IPv6-Only Hosting:** Sharing experiences of running an IPv6-only hosting provider, challenges with dual stack, which applications do not work, and lessons learned about address allocation and security.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IPv6-Only Multi-Domain Framework Draft:** A call for adoption was proposed for the draft.
*   **Extension Header Testing:** The group will proceed with a set of drafts focusing on different topologies and equipment. Implementation details for crafting packets with extension headers should be added to the draft.
*   **Action Item:** Presenters of drafts will be asked to send their drafts to the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion of the discussed drafts on the mailing list.
*   The Extension Header Testing team will continue development of drafts for CDN and cloud provider topologies.
*   Volunteers should be found to create summary drafts of frequently debated IPv6 topics.
