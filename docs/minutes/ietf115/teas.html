<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 08 Nov 2022 15:00</p>
<h1>teas</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The TEAS (Traffic Engineering Architecture and Signaling) session in London covered several important topics related to network slicing, traffic mapping, topology filtering, and end-to-end service management. Presentations included updates on drafts addressing 5G network slicing, realization of ietf Network slices for the 5G use case, network slice mapping, traffic mapping, topology filtering, and pluggable interface management. Discussions focused on collaboration, potential overlap between documents, and the need for standardized Yang models.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>ITM Network Slices Application in 5G:</strong> Update on draft merging three documents, focusing on the role of ietf Network slices in 5G and mapping 3GPP network slices to ietf slices.</li>
<li><strong>Realization of ITF Network Slices for 5G:</strong> Discussion of using current IP/MPLS technologies to implement ietf Network slices for 5G, including handoff methods (VLAN, IP, inter-provider option B) and handling 5QI. Potential overlap with the &quot;ITM Network Slices Application in 5G&quot; document was acknowledged.</li>
<li><strong>Network Slice Mapping:</strong> Presentation of a draft for mapping slice service to underlying resources, particularly focusing on mapping to NRP (Network Resource Partitioning). Feedback was solicited on whether to allow configuration or make it read-only.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Mapping Yang Model:</strong> Presentation of a straw man draft discussing the need for a standardized traffic mapping model, addressing the issue of how to identify traffic flows over established paths and services. The usefulness and approach of this model were debated.</li>
<li><strong>Topology Filter and Topology Filter Sets:</strong> Update on the topology filter construct, clarifying its scope and potential use cases like network resource partitioning and TE path computation constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Precision Availability Metrics in Multi-SO-Will Govern End-to-End Services:</strong> Proposed metrics for expressing service availability according to performance requirements and service level objectives (SLOs), specifically focusing on time intervals.</li>
<li><strong>Pluggable Interface Management:</strong> This presentation covered the need to manage full networks, independent of layers, and the emergence of pluggable DWDM interfaces. It addressed the use of hierarchical controllers (mdsc) and the sharing of information between packet and optical PNCs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>ITM Network Slices Application in 5G:</strong>  Working group adoption poll resulted in mixed support. Further discussion and revision are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Realization of ITF Network Slices for 5G:</strong> Authors to consider collaboration and potential merging or cross-referencing with the &quot;ITM Network Slices Application in 5G&quot; document.</li>
<li><strong>Network Slice Mapping:</strong> Solicit feedback on making the mapping read-only and whether mapping is needed at the collection group/connectivity construct level.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Mapping Yang Model:</strong>  Solicit feedback on whether the proposed model is useful and where this work belongs (this working group or elsewhere).  Consider synergies with ACL base model revision in netmod.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to continue revising their drafts based on feedback received during the session.</li>
<li>Further discussion on the mailing list regarding collaboration and merging of documents.</li>
<li>Explore synergies with other working groups (e.g., netmod).</li>
<li>httmpy design team to discuss the pluggable interface management draft.</li>
</ul>
