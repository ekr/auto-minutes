## Summary
The NTP working group meeting at IETF 115 covered document status updates, discussions on interleave modes, Kronos, NTPv5, rough time, and NTS over PTP.  Key decisions included adopting the NTPv5 specification as a working group document and plans for virtual interim meetings to maintain momentum. The group also discussed the challenges in balancing security and performance in NTPv5, time scale considerations, and the need for more detailed use cases and requirements.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Interleave Modes:** Discussion on whether to update the interleave modes document with additional safety information and resubmit, or defer to V5. Concerns from operational personnel regarding safety.
*   **Kronos:** Ready to go to the ISG after addressing typos and updating the name from "Kronos" with a "c" to "Kronos" with a "k".
*   **NTPv5 Hackathon:** Successful hackathon with two interoperable experimental implementations. Identified minor issues in implementation and potential issues with timescale offsets for UT1.
*   **NTPv5 Use Cases and Requirements:**  Need for more detail, particularly on balancing synchronization performance versus security.  Discussion of authenticated vs unauthenticated fields.
*   **NTPv5 Specification:**  Discussion of time scales. Two approaches: all timestamps in one specific time scale (e.g., TAI or UTC) or leaving it open with translation mechanisms.
*   **Rough Time:** Google expressed interest and plans to post comments and implement a future ID. Need for more review and comments on the mailing list.
*   **NTS over PTP:**  Still interest, awaiting updates from primary author and industry partner collaboration.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Interleave Modes:** Marislov will review the latest draft, check the diff since the last discussion, and chase down people to re-review it.
*   **NTPv5 Specification:** Adopt NTPV5 specification as a working group document. Marislav to update the draft with the working group name.
*   **NTPv5 Use Cases and Requirements:**  James to be contacted to see if working group last call can be done for this document.
*   **Rough Time:** Encourage comments and review on mailing list.
*   **Updating NTP Registries:** Eric to double check for AD eval.
*   **Enterprise Profile:** Authors to submit updated draft.

## Next Steps
*   Schedule virtual interim meetings in November, December and January to discuss NTPv5 requirements and deployment of NTS.
*   Plan for hackathon activity at IETF in Yokohama.
*   Gather deployment reports and experimental results of NTS.
