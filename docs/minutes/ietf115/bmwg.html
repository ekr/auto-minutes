<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 10 Nov 2022 09:30</p>
<h1>bmwg</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The BMWG session covered a range of benchmarking methodologies and proposals. Discussions included updates on existing drafts, new proposals for benchmarking containerized infrastructures, MPLS and IPv6 segment routing, and space-terrestrial networks. The session focused on technical details, identifying areas for improvement, and soliciting feedback from the working group.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple Loss Ratio Search (MLR Search):</strong> The authors presented updates to the draft, emphasizing the problem statement and methodology. They requested feedback on the problem definitions to guide further development.</li>
<li><strong>Network Security Device Performance:</strong> The IESG discuss ballots have been resolved. A timeline for approval announcement is awaited.</li>
<li><strong>Yang Data Model for Network Test Error Management:</strong> An update was provided on the draft's progress, including the addition of modifiers for dynamic data fields and a hackathon implementation. There was a discussion about potential constraints to avoid implementation challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Benchmarking Methodology for Stateful NAT XY Gateways:</strong> The authors discussed updates to the draft, including scalability measurements and a recommended reporting format.  Questions were raised about methods for generating multiple network flows and different types of scalability to examine.</li>
<li><strong>Considerations for Benchmarking Containerized Infrastructures:</strong> The presentation detailed updates to the draft, focusing on deployment scenarios, configuration parameters, networking models (including eBPF), and performance impacts. The authors seek working group adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Benchmarking Methodology for MPLS Segment Routing (SR-MPLS):</strong> An update was presented on the draft with emphasis on recent changes based on feedback. The co-authors are looking for additional comments and support on a potential adoption for the draft.</li>
<li><strong>Benchmarking Methodology for IPv6 Segment Routing (SRv6):</strong> An update was presented on the draft with emphasis on recent changes based on feedback. The co-authors are looking for additional comments and support on a potential adoption for the draft. Boris indicated he will review again and provide feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Problems and Requirements for Evaluation of Integrated Space and Terrestrial Networks:</strong>  The presenter clarified the scope of work related to the charter and highlighted key aspects to benchmarking. Zaki Y is to focus on the SIC Benchmarking draft.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Warren to provide a timeline for the approval announcement of the Network Security Device Performance draft.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> MLR Search authors (Mosiak and Bratko) to review the containerized infrastructure benchmarking draft and provide feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> SR-MPLS and SRv6 authors to include lab results/implementation experience in future drafts.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> SRv6 authors to consider Boris's further review.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> ICN authors (Zaki Y) to work on the sic benchmarking draft.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> ICN authors to get Satellite Communications experts to review drafts to add credibility.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to incorporate feedback received during the session into their respective drafts.</li>
<li>Continue discussions on the mailing list regarding the adoption of various drafts.</li>
<li>Prepare for the next BMWG session in March 2023.</li>
</ul>
