## Summary
The RAW working group meeting focused primarily on the architecture draft and its relationship to detnet. Key discussion points included the definition of "track" vs. "path", the role of the Path Computation Element (PCE) and Path Selection Engine (PSE), and the overall architecture of reliable wireless. A decision was made to clarify terminology and ensure alignment with detnet standards.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Document Split:** The architecture document will be split into two, focusing on PSE and perio separately.
*   **Terminology:** Extensive discussion regarding the terms "track" vs. "path", with a drive toward aligning with detnet terminology where possible. Agreement that a terminology section in the document defining these terms is necessary.  The idea of "end-to-end service" as an alternative to the term "track" was suggested and explored.
*   **PCE/PSE Role:** Clarification of the roles of the PCE and PSE within the RAW architecture, with the PSE serving as a local optimization engine.
*   **Control Loop:** Emphasis on the RAW architecture being a control loop using a UDA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) model.
*   **Service Layer:** Discussion of whether PSE is a service layer function or a control plane function. Consensus that it's a control plane activity.
*   **Detnet Alignment:**  Strong emphasis on aligning with detnet terminology and architecture. Suggestion to engage with the C Camp working group to further align with ietf traffic engineering.
*   **5G Integration:** Presentation of 5G access as a "black box" from the RAW perspective, with the focus on layer 3 OEM and access switching.
*   **Accessibility:** Concerns raised about the accessibility of both RAW and detnet documents to newcomers.
*   **New vs. Existing Technology:** Lou voiced concern that the document was not focusing on new concepts.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Document Split:** The architecture document will be split with Pascal as editor for both resulting documents. Acknowledgment of contributors will be added to a section.
*   **Terminology Clarification:** Don and Balash will assist Pascal in rewriting terminology sections of the architecture document to align with detnet terminology and improve clarity.
*   **Diagrams:** Lou and others will explore providing existing or new diagrams to better illustrate the relationship between detnet and RAW architectures, especially concerning service functions and protection mechanisms.
*   **Mailing List:** Encourage use of the mailing list for ongoing discussion and review.

## Next Steps
*   Pascal, with assistance from Don and Balash, will revise the architecture document to clarify terminology and better align with detnet.
*   Lou et al. to provide diagrams illustrating the RAW architecture in relation to detnet concepts.
*   Continued discussion on the RAW mailing list to address outstanding issues and progress towards document completion.
