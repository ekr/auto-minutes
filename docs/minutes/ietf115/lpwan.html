## Summary

The lpwan working group met to discuss its current status, chartering, and future work. Key topics included finalizing existing drafts, re-chartering discussions focusing on expanding the scope beyond LPWAN, new work proposals on Chic convergence profiles, security considerations in Chic architecture, and a brief update on the hackathon. The group decided to proceed with drafting a re-chartering proposal based on the discussed items.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Working Group Status:** Discussion on the status of existing drafts like the YANG data model, NB-IoT, Chic over Sigfox, and Compound Defrag. The YANG data model is in the editor's queue. NB-IoT is being discussed with 3GPP. Chic over Sigfox and Compound Defrag are ready to be submitted.
*   **OAM Document:** Confirmed continued interest in the OAM document with Dominic expressing willingness to continue working on it.
*   **Architecture Document:**  Security section needs expansion to include security below the transport layer (e.g., ESP, IPsec). Bob Moskowitz raised the point about the existing architecture not addressing security concerns below the transport layer which becomes increasingly important as the Chic protocol becomes used in new environments.
*   **Re-chartering Discussion:**
    *   Expanding the scope beyond LPWAN to include protocols like PPP, Generic AP tunnels, and new aviation radio technology (Navlink).
    *   Carlos suggested renaming the group to reflect the broader scope of Chic applications.
    *   Discussion of a new method for handling fragment loss using forward error correction (FEC) in addition to ARQ. This will be called HAQR fragments.
    *   The Chic header (protocol type, ether type, UDP port). Interaction with the int area with regard to obtaining protocol number, new ether type and UDP port and interaction with the IEEE. The group considered defining a new IPv6 extension header for Chic.
    *   Session Setup and Rule Discovery: A significant new area for work, focusing on establishing secure sessions and exchanging rules between devices and applications. Discussions on protection against impersonation and attacks.
    *   Yang Optimizations for CoreConf: How to efficiently use CoreConf over Chic.
*   **Chic Convergence Profile (Sergio Aguilar):**
    *   Motivation: to make LPWAN technology transparent to the application.
    *   Proposal: A single convergent Chic fragmentation and reassembly sublayer to reduce code complexity and maintenance, applicable across different LPWAN technologies.
    *   Use cases: multi-radio devices, multi-network applications, generic fragmentation/reassembly profile, network redundancy.
*   **Security Considerations (Laurent):**  The group had a discussion of security considerations for the Young data model and the architecture in general, with focus on the need to prevent compromised devices from pushing malicious rules to the core network that could compromise the entire network.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Chic over Sigfox and Compound Defrag:** Anna to push the button to finalize and submit the Chic over Sigfox draft. Sergio to double-check the Compound Defrag draft for outstanding nits and republish if needed.  After republication, it will be submitted.
*   **Re-chartering Proposal:** The chairs will proceed with drafting a re-chartering proposal based on the items discussed.
*   **Security Architecture:** Beef up the security section of the architecture document, with a focus on the use cases discussed.
*   **Hackathon:**  Acknowledge the achievements and thank all the participants in the hackathon.

## Next Steps

*   Chairs to draft and circulate a re-chartering proposal for review and discussion.
*   Organize the next round of interim meetings.
*   Continue working on implementation and testing efforts.
