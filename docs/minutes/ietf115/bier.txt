## Summary

This BIER working group meeting covered a range of topics, including document status updates, discussion of an efficient P4-based BIER implementation on Tofino, a new approach for recursive bit masks, and updates on BIER FRR and TE extensions. Several documents were identified for last call, and the need for shepherds was highlighted.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Status:** Updates were provided on the status of various BIER-related drafts. The BIER TE document has been approved as RFC. Several documents are nearing last call and require shepherds.
*   **P4-based BIER Implementation:** Stefan presented an efficient P4-based BIER implementation on the Tofino platform, focusing on reducing recirculation and improving performance using configurable Port Clusters.
*   **Recursive Bit Masks:** Tallest presented a new approach for BIER using recursive bit masks, aiming to improve scalability and efficiency, particularly in large networks. The approach uses a distributed way of encoding and processing the bitstrings, where each router only examines the portion relevant to itself, thereby potentially improving scaling.
*   **BIER FRR Update:** Discussions about the requirement to support LFA in every node which the BFR already supports, so the draft's requirement is not completely correct.
*   **BIER TE Extension Update:** Presentation regarding the use of new advertisement to reduce bytes consumption, which is a simple move of ID advertisement.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **BIER Ping Draft:** The chairs will assign an editor to the BIER ping draft to facilitate its progress.
*   **BIER Proxy Draft:** Jeffrey will refresh the BIER proxy draft and request a shepherd.
*   **Documents for Last Call:** The following drafts will be put up for last call.
    *   BIER Proxy Draft (mldp one)
    *   BIER Prefix Redistribute
*   **BGPD update Draft:** Send the BGPD extension document to IDR working group, plus call again, and assign a Shepard.
*   **Early Reviews:** Chairs will remind authors about the routing area policy requiring early reviews before drafts go to area directors after last call.
*   **Action Item:** Authors of all drafts nearing last call should ensure they are updated to address all outstanding comments.

## Next Steps

*   The chairs will follow up with authors regarding editor assignments and shepherd requests.
*   The working group will review and provide feedback on the recursive bit masks proposal (RBS) on the mailing list.
*   Authors will address IDR's comments and concerns after the draft is sent to them.
*   The BIER working group will continue to track the progress of active drafts and schedule future discussions as needed.
