<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 08 Nov 2022 09:30</p>
<h1>avtcore</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The avtcore meeting covered several important topics, including draft statuses, adoption calls, and technical discussions surrounding RTP over QUIC and S frame packetization.  The primary focus was on the challenges associated with S frame and its interaction with RTP over QUIC, leading to discussions about potential solutions for MTU-related issues and re-packetization strategies. Finally, the adoption of RTP over quick and EVC as well as RV trailer for b3c drafts were discussed.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Game State over RTP Adoption:</strong> Initial adoption call had low response.  Discussion moved to identifying a more appropriate venue, considering lack of expertise in the working group for game state formats. Recommendation for independent stream RFC for Ayana Registries.</li>
<li><strong>RV Trailer for b3c Adoption:</strong> Consensus reached to adopt the RV trailer draft.</li>
<li><strong>RGCP Messages for Green Metadata:</strong> Call for adoption still ongoing.</li>
<li><strong>RTP for Skip:</strong> Reviewers haven't responded to the latest draft. Decision to send a reminder and proceed accordingly.  Debate about the increasing bureaucracy of the IETF process.</li>
<li><strong>RTP over QUIC Sandbox:</strong> Observations on glass-to-glass latency, reordering, and bandwidth consumption in a JavaScript implementation.  Findings revealed the importance of proper use of the web transport API.</li>
<li><strong>S Frame and RTP over QUIC (Issue 29):</strong> Problem identified: potential need for codec-specific knowledge for repacketization with S frame over RTP over QUIC due to encrypted payloads. Proposed solution involving adding S frame sequence numbers and chunk indexes to the RTP payload. Discussion about S frame's goal of single auth tag.</li>
<li><strong>RTP over QUIC Updates:</strong> Addition of explicit length field to allow for sender-side segmentation. Issues with canceling streams when multiple packets are present on a stream. Agreement to limit to one media frame per stream to ease cancellation issues.</li>
<li><strong>STP Signaling Updates</strong> An adoption call was requested.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Game State over RTP:</strong>  The working group recommends that Colin pursue this work via the independent stream RFC process. The working group will not object to its publication as an independent submission.</li>
<li><strong>RV Trailer for b3c:</strong> The working group will adopt this draft. The author should submit an ietf draft.</li>
<li><strong>RTP for Skip:</strong> Dan will send a final reminder to reviewers.</li>
<li><strong>S Frame and RTP over QUIC (Issue 29):</strong> The working group will organize an interim meeting or side meeting to discuss issue 29 and determine a path forward. Peter to attend the meeting to address the issues with his proposed draft. A decision was made that it would be useful to work on it as a re-packetization solution for RTP over quick for future transports as well.</li>
<li><strong>RTP over QUIC Updates:</strong>  Limit the draft to one media frame per stream to simplify cancellation mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>STP Signaling Updates:</strong> After the presentation of all the slides there would be a call for adoption. This will occur later.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Organize an interim meeting/side meeting to discuss S frame packetization (Issue 29).</li>
<li>Shepherd Dan Wing's SKIP draft and resolve the reviewers comments, send reviewer reminders.</li>
<li>Discuss the details around the adoption and integration with RTP over Quick as well as STP over quick drafts.</li>
<li>Follow up with Bernard and I on the list to address any outstanding comments and plan next steps for the relevant drafts.</li>
</ul>
