# shmoo

## Summary

This was a short meeting focused on the remaining deliverables of the shmoo working group. Two RFCs have been published, and the group discussed progressing the remaining working group documents. The primary focus was on the "online meetings" draft and its potential future. The WG is aiming to complete the remaining work and then close, with any future, related work being handled outside the WG structure.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Published RFCs:** The RFCs concerning cancellation considerations on running an IETF hackathon have been published.
*   **Remaining Working Group Documents:** Focus on progressing the remaining "online meetings" document.
*   **Dropped Deliverables:** Discussion about dropping planned deliverables related to meeting cadence, technology requirements, and hybrid meeting planning due to lack of progress.  The benefits of robust remote participation in all meetings were acknowledged.
*   **Mark Nottingham's Draft:** Clarification on the status of Mark Nottingham's draft presented at a previous IETF. It was referred to shmoo from the gender's past area and requires confirmation from Mark about his intentions for the draft. Lars Eggert offered to AD-sponsor any work related to these topics after the WG closes.
*   **Online Meetings Draft Status:** Discussion on whether the "online meetings" draft should be a BCP or remain an informational document.  Consensus was to keep it as an informational document due to lessons learned from the pandemic and the potential for overstating guidance.
*   **Editorial Pass:** Martin will do an editorial pass on the "online meetings" draft, structuring it more like a BCP with 2119 words, but keeping the content informational and without substantive changes.
* Remote participation works well and its something that works well going forward.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:**  The chairs (presumably) will follow up with Mark Nottingham regarding the status of his draft.
*   **Action Item:** Martin will perform an editorial pass on the "online meetings" draft, aiming for completion by the end of the month (November), and circulate for a brief review period before final publication.
*   **Decision:** The "online meetings" draft will remain an informational document.
*   **Decision:** The working group will aim to complete work on the "online meetings" draft and then close.
* The mailing list will remain open after the working group closes.

## Next Steps

1. Chairs to contact Mark Nottingham.
2. Martin to complete the editorial pass of the "online meetings" draft.
3. After the editorial pass, a brief hold-off period for review.
4. Progress the document.
5.  Close the working group.
