## Summary
The BMWG session covered a range of benchmarking methodologies and proposals. Discussions included updates on existing drafts, new proposals for benchmarking containerized infrastructures, MPLS and IPv6 segment routing, and space-terrestrial networks. The session focused on technical details, identifying areas for improvement, and soliciting feedback from the working group.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Multiple Loss Ratio Search (MLR Search):** The authors presented updates to the draft, emphasizing the problem statement and methodology. They requested feedback on the problem definitions to guide further development.
*   **Network Security Device Performance:** The IESG discuss ballots have been resolved. A timeline for approval announcement is awaited.
*   **Yang Data Model for Network Test Error Management:** An update was provided on the draft's progress, including the addition of modifiers for dynamic data fields and a hackathon implementation. There was a discussion about potential constraints to avoid implementation challenges.
*   **Benchmarking Methodology for Stateful NAT XY Gateways:** The authors discussed updates to the draft, including scalability measurements and a recommended reporting format.  Questions were raised about methods for generating multiple network flows and different types of scalability to examine.
*   **Considerations for Benchmarking Containerized Infrastructures:** The presentation detailed updates to the draft, focusing on deployment scenarios, configuration parameters, networking models (including eBPF), and performance impacts. The authors seek working group adoption.
*   **Benchmarking Methodology for MPLS Segment Routing (SR-MPLS):** An update was presented on the draft with emphasis on recent changes based on feedback. The co-authors are looking for additional comments and support on a potential adoption for the draft.
*   **Benchmarking Methodology for IPv6 Segment Routing (SRv6):** An update was presented on the draft with emphasis on recent changes based on feedback. The co-authors are looking for additional comments and support on a potential adoption for the draft. Boris indicated he will review again and provide feedback.
*   **Problems and Requirements for Evaluation of Integrated Space and Terrestrial Networks:**  The presenter clarified the scope of work related to the charter and highlighted key aspects to benchmarking. Zaki Y is to focus on the SIC Benchmarking draft.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Warren to provide a timeline for the approval announcement of the Network Security Device Performance draft.
*   **Action Item:** MLR Search authors (Mosiak and Bratko) to review the containerized infrastructure benchmarking draft and provide feedback.
*   **Action Item:** SR-MPLS and SRv6 authors to include lab results/implementation experience in future drafts.
*   **Action Item:** SRv6 authors to consider Boris's further review.
*   **Action Item:** ICN authors (Zaki Y) to work on the sic benchmarking draft.
*   **Action Item:** ICN authors to get Satellite Communications experts to review drafts to add credibility.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to incorporate feedback received during the session into their respective drafts.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list regarding the adoption of various drafts.
*   Prepare for the next BMWG session in March 2023.
