<h1>Technology Deep Dive</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This session provided a technical overview of QUIC, covering its fundamental principles, immediate value proposition, and the technologies it enables. The session included presentations on QUIC's architecture and handshake process, with a focus on security and denial-of-service mitigation. It also explored how QUIC facilitates new advancements such as Mask and media delivery over QUIC.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>QUIC as a Transport Protocol:</strong> QUIC is positioned as a new transport protocol parallel to TCP and TLS, deliberately compressing multiple layers for improved acceleration and deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Streaming:</strong> QUIC offers multi-streaming capabilities within a single connection, providing multiple ordered byte streams suitable for web applications with numerous independent objects.</li>
<li><strong>UDP Foundation:</strong> QUIC is built on UDP to navigate existing internet infrastructure with middleboxes and firewalls, enabling user-space deployment while recreating and improving TCP functionalities.</li>
<li><strong>Baked-in Encryption:</strong> Encryption is integral to QUIC, protecting both data and headers using TLS 1.3 for key negotiation, preventing ossification by middleboxes and allowing for protocol evolution.</li>
<li><strong>Zero RTT:</strong> QUIC enables zero round trip time connection setup with transport and crypto handshake, providing low-latency connections.</li>
<li><strong>Connection Migration:</strong> QUIC supports connection migration for improved resilience.</li>
<li><strong>Troubleshooting and Debugging:</strong> QUIC allows for the logging of transport and network-level traces alongside application-level traces due to its user-space implementation, simplifying debugging processes.</li>
<li><strong>Address Validation and Amplification Mitigation:</strong> QUIC includes denial-of-service mitigations, employing address validation techniques, such as retry mechanisms and implicit tokens, to prevent handshake amplification attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Layering Architecture:</strong> QUIC's architecture is viewed more as a software architecture than strict layering, where components provide capabilities and interact with each other, with TLS providing cryptographic assurances.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hold questions until the panel discussion tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30 AM.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Attend the second Technology Deep Dive session tomorrow to delve deeper into QUIC deployments at scale, debugging techniques, and participate in the panel discussion.</li>

## Summary

This session provided an in-depth look at various aspects of deploying, observing, and debugging QUIC.  Discussions covered practical experiences at Google with QUIC load balancing, mitigating blackholing, and handling zero-RTT issues, along with practical guidance on using Wireshark and qlog for troubleshooting.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **QUIC Load Balancing:**
    *   Discussed challenges of using Anycast with QUIC, particularly related to connection migration and flapping BGP routes.
    *   Highlighted the use of encrypted connection IDs within QUIC to improve linkability and routing.
    *   Quick LB draft has a single connection ID format. Rotation of keys is possible using configuration IDs.
    *   Goal is deploying by Q2 or Q1 of next year.
*   **Blackholing Mitigation:**
    *   Explained that five-tuples can be blackholed, causing connection timeouts and poor user experience.
    *   Described a strategy to close connections after five consecutive probe timeouts.
    *   Port migration (changing the client-side port) was presented as an effective solution to overcome blackholing.
*   **Zero-RTT Challenges:**
    *   Highlighted the complexity of implementing zero-RTT in QUIC due to multiple packet number spaces and key management.
    *   Shared experiences of a Google outage caused by a &quot;contagion&quot; bug related to resumption information sent by Google front ends. Key point was that rollbacks didn't work because the state was in clients.
    *   Emphasized the importance of thorough testing and robust tooling to ensure zero-RTT actually improves performance.
*   **Observing and Debugging QUIC:**
    *   Stressed that QUIC is not TCP, TLS, or HTTP; it's a new transport protocol with its own considerations.
    *   Emphasized the importance of understanding TLS for debugging QUIC handshakes.
    *   Discussed the use of Wireshark (version 3.4+) with SSL key log files for dissecting and decrypting QUIC packets.
    *   Highlighted the benefits of using qlog and cuviz for richer insights into QUIC connection behavior.
    *   Qviz is an excellent tool for visualizing QLOG output.
    *   Explained the importance of initial and handshake packet types.
*   **QUIC Applicability and Manageability:**
    *   Mentioned RFC 9308 - QUIC Applicability, which discusses transport protocol features and adapting an application to work on QUIC
    *   Mentioned RFC - Manageability Draft which discusses how to analyze quick.
*   **BGP over QUIC:**
     * There were multiple bgp over quick drafts.
     * The quick working group is available for early reviews.
     * Key distribution seems like a potential challenge.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Re-export the slides with the timeline for the Google Outage (Ian).
*   **Action Item:** George Michaelson asked if someone could write a library that allows single packet transactional work reliably across address Mobility.

## Next Steps

*   Continue deployment of QUIC load balancing.
*   Further explore and refine blackholing mitigation techniques.
*   Improve testing and tooling for zero-RTT implementations.
*   Address version ossification to ensure future-proof accessibility.
