## Summary

The LISP working group meeting covered several key topics, including updates on the hexagon draft, Geo prefixes, satellite networks, and site external connectivity. The group also briefly discussed the PubSub draft and potential rechartering. Key discussions revolved around privacy concerns with Geo prefixes, the application of LISP to satellite networks, and the mechanics of dynamic external connectivity for LISP sites.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Hexagon Draft:** Updates included addressing AD review feedback and industry developments, particularly concerning interoperability testing in Tokyo and upcoming POCs using Cisco Wi-Fi and private 5G breakouts. Sharon emphasized the relevance of hexagons and digital twins in connected mobility, especially regarding the economic benefits of fog fragmentation and Edge computing.
*   **Geo Prefixes:** Dino presented the Geo prefixes document, highlighting the alignment of geocoordinate encodings with ISIS, OSPF, and BGP. Privacy considerations were a major point of discussion, with suggestions to include a dedicated privacy considerations section in the draft, referencing RFC 6973. Alternatives for managing geoprivacy of different types of objects using instance IDs and ephemeral EIDs were discussed.
*   **Satellite Networks:** Dino presented the LISP in Satellite Networks draft, explaining how LISP can run over satellite underlays without requiring changes to the satellite network itself. Test scenarios using Starlink were presented, and collaboration for further testing was encouraged. There was a discussion regarding whether the mapping system needs to reside in space to get better latency.
*   **Site External Connectivity:** Prakash presented the Site External Connectivity draft, which addresses dynamic external connectivity for unknown or unregistered EIDs. The discussion focused on the use of proxy ETRs (PXTRs) and the content of the action value within negative map replies. Concerns were raised about potential traffic attraction issues with the suggested approach.
*   **PubSub:** Alberto requested that working group members review the PubSub draft on the list.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Geo Prefixes:** Dino to add a dedicated privacy considerations section to the Geo prefixes draft, referencing RFC 6973 and other relevant documents.
*   **Site External Connectivity:** Prakash to continue discussion on the mailing list regarding traffic attraction issues with negative map replies.
*   **PubSub:** Participants to review the PubSub draft and provide feedback on the mailing list.
*   **Satellite Networks:** Lihan to open a discussion thread on the mailing list concerning the LISP in satellite networks draft.
*   **Rechartering:** The chair deferred the discussion on rechartering to the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on the mailing list for all topics
*   Address action items
*   Prepare for IETF 116
