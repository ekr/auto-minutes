## Summary

The WISH working group met at IETF 115 to discuss the progress of the WISH-Whip draft and the potential for rechartering the group to include WHEP (WebRTC HTTP Egress Protocol). Sergio presented an update on the WISH-Whip draft, focusing on the changes from version 04 to 05, including the addition of the Asset-Path header and clarifications on various aspects of the protocol. The group also discussed the need for WHEP and its potential benefits, including interoperability between WebRTC services, backup solutions, and integration with existing media players. There was a general consensus to proceed with rechartering after the WISH-Whip draft is finalized.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **WISH-Whip Draft Update:** Sergio presented the changes in draft 05 and requested feedback on the correctness of the Asset-Path header usage in 201 responses. He plans to submit draft 06 soon.
*   **Working Group Last Call:** The group agreed to start the working group last call for WISH-Whip as soon as draft 06 is available, potentially next week, with a slightly longer duration due to upcoming holidays.
*   **WHEP Motivation:** Discussion centered on the motivations for WHEP, including interoperability between WebRTC services, backup solutions for service downtime, and integration with the broader media ecosystem (e.g., MPEG-DASH).
*   **Rechartering for WHEP:**  The group discussed whether to recharter to include WHEP. There was broad support, with concerns raised about potential scope creep and resource constraints. Adam, who was previously hesitant, voiced his support.
*   **WHEP Functionality:** The discussion included features of DASH that might be needed for WHEP (e.g., subtitles, multiple audio languages). The desire to avoid feature creep was also voiced, with the idea to possibly re-use existing solutions for subtitles etc.
*   **Offer/Answer Reversal:** The possibility of the server providing the initial SDP offer was discussed but generally discouraged as unnecessary, adding complexity and potentially conflicting with dynamic codec selection.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** Proceed with working group last call for WISH-Whip starting next week, pending submission of draft 06.
    *   **Action Item:** Sergio to submit draft 06 of WISH-Whip in the next couple of days.
    *   **Action Item:** Chairs (Sean and Niels) to determine shepherd and begin the process of moving the document forward.
*   **Decision:** Start the rechartering process for WHEP after WISH-Whip is finalized.
    *   **Action Item:** Chairs to set up a GitHub repository with the original charter and invite contributions for revisions related to WHEP.

## Next Steps

1.  Sergio will submit WISH-Whip draft 06.
2.  The working group last call for WISH-Whip will commence.
3.  Chairs will start a GitHub repo for charter revision.
4.  Discussion on WHEP will continue on the mailing list.
