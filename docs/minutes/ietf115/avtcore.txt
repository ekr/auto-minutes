## Summary

The avtcore meeting covered several important topics, including draft statuses, adoption calls, and technical discussions surrounding RTP over QUIC and S frame packetization.  The primary focus was on the challenges associated with S frame and its interaction with RTP over QUIC, leading to discussions about potential solutions for MTU-related issues and re-packetization strategies. Finally, the adoption of RTP over quick and EVC as well as RV trailer for b3c drafts were discussed.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Game State over RTP Adoption:** Initial adoption call had low response.  Discussion moved to identifying a more appropriate venue, considering lack of expertise in the working group for game state formats. Recommendation for independent stream RFC for Ayana Registries.
*   **RV Trailer for b3c Adoption:** Consensus reached to adopt the RV trailer draft.
*   **RGCP Messages for Green Metadata:** Call for adoption still ongoing.
*   **RTP for Skip:** Reviewers haven't responded to the latest draft. Decision to send a reminder and proceed accordingly.  Debate about the increasing bureaucracy of the IETF process.
*   **RTP over QUIC Sandbox:** Observations on glass-to-glass latency, reordering, and bandwidth consumption in a JavaScript implementation.  Findings revealed the importance of proper use of the web transport API.
*   **S Frame and RTP over QUIC (Issue 29):** Problem identified: potential need for codec-specific knowledge for repacketization with S frame over RTP over QUIC due to encrypted payloads. Proposed solution involving adding S frame sequence numbers and chunk indexes to the RTP payload. Discussion about S frame's goal of single auth tag.
*   **RTP over QUIC Updates:** Addition of explicit length field to allow for sender-side segmentation. Issues with canceling streams when multiple packets are present on a stream. Agreement to limit to one media frame per stream to ease cancellation issues.
* **STP Signaling Updates** An adoption call was requested.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Game State over RTP:**  The working group recommends that Colin pursue this work via the independent stream RFC process. The working group will not object to its publication as an independent submission.
*   **RV Trailer for b3c:** The working group will adopt this draft. The author should submit an ietf draft.
*   **RTP for Skip:** Dan will send a final reminder to reviewers.
*   **S Frame and RTP over QUIC (Issue 29):** The working group will organize an interim meeting or side meeting to discuss issue 29 and determine a path forward. Peter to attend the meeting to address the issues with his proposed draft. A decision was made that it would be useful to work on it as a re-packetization solution for RTP over quick for future transports as well.
*   **RTP over QUIC Updates:**  Limit the draft to one media frame per stream to simplify cancellation mechanisms.
*   **STP Signaling Updates:** After the presentation of all the slides there would be a call for adoption. This will occur later.

## Next Steps

*   Organize an interim meeting/side meeting to discuss S frame packetization (Issue 29).
*   Shepherd Dan Wing's SKIP draft and resolve the reviewers comments, send reviewer reminders.
*   Discuss the details around the adoption and integration with RTP over Quick as well as STP over quick drafts.
*   Follow up with Bernard and I on the list to address any outstanding comments and plan next steps for the relevant drafts.
