## Summary

The intarea meeting at IETF 115 covered several topics including updates on RFC 7042 bis, IEEE initiatives related to ether type registries, a request for an IP protocol number for chic header compression, an update on IP Parcels, and a discussion about the standardization of eBPF. A side meeting was announced to discuss the appropriate standardization venue for eBPF.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RFC 7042 bis (IANA OUI Allocation):** Don Eastlake presented an update on RFC 7042 bis, which is nearing working group last call. Key points included the renaming of the "Ethernet Numbers" IANA web page to "IANA Ethernet Number page" and the movement of the LLDP TLV subtype registry to the IANA page. The draft describes the allocation of parameters under the IANA OUI and 802 code points. There was a question about the long-term value of the "OUI Assignments" section on the informational IANA web page. The draft also lacks instruction on how to get an EtherType.

*   **IEEE/IETF Coordination on Registries:** Juan Carlos Zuniga presented ongoing discussions between IEEE and IETF regarding registries related to Mac addresses and ether types, referencing work from the IEEE standards association registration authority committee (Iraq), IEEE SA and IEEE 802.1. He suggested holding publication of the RFC 7042 bis draft to allow for input from IEEE, aiming for consistency and potential harmonization of registries.

*   **Chic IP Protocol Number:** Bob Heaney presented a request for an IP protocol number for Chic header compression to enable Chic at the IP level, particularly in scenarios with constrained links within a non-compressible security wrapper.  The discussion expanded to include the possibility of requesting an ether type and a UDP port number for Chic as well.  Concerns were raised about whether the UDP port number request falls within the interior area of responsibility.

*   **IP Parcels:** Fred Baker presented an update on the IP Parcels implementation, showcasing running code in the Linux kernel and the dtn ltp UDP application. The initial call for adoption had negative results.

*   **eBPF Standardization:** Dates presented an overview of eBPF and announced a side meeting to discuss where to standardize eBPF, specifically addressing which standardization development organization (SDO) is most appropriate. The goal of the side meeting is not to discuss the technical aspects of eBPF, but to determine the best place for standardization, considering factors such as change control and the rapid evolution of the technology.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **RFC 7042 bis:** Hold publication and encourage review by the IEEE. Don Eastlake will add an appendix on the procedure for getting an EtherType, reflecting current best practices for IESG approval and following through to the application process with the IEEE registration authority.
*   **Chic IP Protocol Number:** Bob Heaney will revise the draft to include requests for an ether type and a UDP port number. The draft will include use case text provided by Pascal and David Black. The document will be submitted as quickly as possible. The working group acknowledged the necessity of involving the transport area in the review process.
*   **IP Parcels:** The call for adoption remains closed unless there is renewed interest and support from additional members of the working group by the end of the week.
*   **eBPF Standardization:** Participants are encouraged to attend the eBPF side meeting to discuss the appropriate standardization venue.

## Next Steps

*   Don Eastlake to update RFC 7042 bis with an appendix on obtaining EtherTypes and submit for IEEE review.
*   Bob Heaney to revise the Chic IP protocol number draft to include requests for an ether type and UDP port number, working with the lpwan group for text inclusion.
*   Mailing list to be updated regarding the outcome of the side meeting to the interior list.
