# Hot RFC Lightning Talks

## Summary

This session consisted of a series of short presentations (4 minutes each) on various topics related to Internet standards and technologies. The goal was to foster discussion and collaboration within the IETF community. Topics ranged from social media architecture to network management and performance monitoring to privacy and security concerns.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Secure Social Media:** A presentation explored the possibility of building a secure, end-to-end encrypted social media platform using existing mesh technologies. The emphasis was on user control and data ownership.
*   **Scalable ID-Based Routing:** Kira, a scalable ID-based routing architecture, was presented as a potential solution for control plane connectivity in future networks. It aims for route efficiency and high resilience and offers zero-touch configuration.
*   **Convergence of Wireless and Wired Networking:** The concept of combining CU, UPF, and PE functions into a single network entity (end UPF) to simplify 5G architecture by utilizing existing IETF WAN technologies was presented.
*   **Supercharging Traceroute:**  An improved traceroute method was presented which enables estimation of the reverse path in addition to the forward path, to account for the internet's asymmetric nature.
*   **Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) Deployment Considerations:** The implications of encrypting the ClientHello message in TLS, particularly on network management and security were discussed. A side meeting was announced to delve into the issue.
*   **Vcons:** a discussion on Vcons, a standardized format for conversations to facilitate data privacy, compliance, and machine learning.
*   **Encrypted Transport over Satellite:** A side meeting on encrypted transport protocols (particularly QUIC) over satellite links, especially geostationary satellites where traditional performance enhancing proxies are used, and recent additions to cover LEO topics.
*   **Formal Specifications for IETF Protocols:**  The benefits of using formal specifications to improve the rigor and security of IETF protocols were presented, specifically citing a case study using QUIC.
*   **SIP over QUIC:**  A project to map Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) over QUIC transport was presented, drawing inspiration from HTTP/3.
*   **Research on Internet Standards Processes:** An analysis on the growing complexity of the IETF process and the development of tools to aid in document review. A research side meeting to discuss these findings was announced.
*   **Time Modulation Protocol (TMP):** A novel Internet Protocol based on synchronizing two processes in time, to potentially increase effective capacity.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Web Filtering:**  The challenges of performing web filtering, particularly for child sexual abuse material, in a privacy-preserving manner in light of increased encryption was presented, seeking community input.
*   **Matrix and Interoperability (MIMI):**  A lightning talk on Matrix's potential role in addressing interoperability requirements under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), with focus on maintaining end-to-end encryption.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **ECH Side Meeting:** A side meeting will be held to discuss encrypted client hello (ECH) deployment considerations in detail. (Richmond 6, 7 PM local time)
*   **Vcon Dispatch Meeting:** A dispatch meeting on Vcons will be held. (9:30 AM).
*   **Encrypted Transport over Satellite Side Meeting:** A side meeting will be held on encrypted transport protocols. (Richmond 6, Wednesday at 11:45 AM)
*   **Formal Specifications Research Group Meeting:** A meeting of the usable formal methods research group will be held on Thursday.
*   **Research on Internet Standards Processes (RASP) Side Meeting:** A side meeting will be held to prepare a research group. (Thursday)
*   **Privacy-Preserving Web Filtering Side Meeting:** A side meeting will be held on Tuesday at 3:30 in Richmond 6.
*   **Encouraged engagement:** Participants are encouraged to provide feedback on the Hot RFC lightning talks format to Spencer Dawkins.

## Next Steps

*   Presenters were encouraged to share follow-up information and engage with interested attendees.
*   Attendees were invited to consider presenting their ideas in future Hot RFC sessions.
*   Continue promoting Hot RFC as an ongoing agenda item to allow new ideas to be presented in the future.
