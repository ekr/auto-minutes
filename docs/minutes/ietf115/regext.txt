## Summary

This meeting of the regext working group covered document management, status of existing work, and presentations on internationalized email addresses, new search functionality for RDAP, and using RDAP for space objects. Key discussions revolved around the handling of internationalized email addresses in EPP, prioritizing documents for working group last call, and the potential adoption of RDAP for managing space object data.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Management:**  Chairs requested authors avoid publishing new versions during working group last call to ease change tracking for document shepherds.
*   **Document Prioritization:** Discussion on which documents are ready for and should be prioritized for working group last call, specifically the Simple Registration Reporting, JS Contact, and Redacted Fields documents.
*   **Internationalized Email Addresses (EAI):** Extensive discussion around handling EAI addresses in EPP, specifically whether to require an ASCII alternative, and the best approach to signal support for EAI.  Different viewpoints were presented on whether to think about it in terms of cardinality (1 or 2 email addresses) or protocols (SMTP vs. SMTP UTF-8).
*   **RDAP Search Functionality:** Tom Harrison presented a proposal for new RDAP search features for IP ranges and ASNs.
*   **RDAP for Space Objects:** Mark presented a proposal to use RDAP for managing space object data, sparking a discussion about the applicability of RDAP to non-internet identifier objects.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Simple Registration Reporting:** Jim Gould will check open items from the mailing list before requesting working group last call.
*   **Redacted Fields:** The chairs will prioritize the Redacted Fields draft for the next working group last call. Jim Gould confirmed the JS Path dependency is expected to be resolved soon. A request to the list will be made for last call.
*   **Internationalized Email Addresses (EAI):**  Jim Gould will publish a new version of the EAI document incorporating feedback from the ITF Last Call and subsequent discussions. The working group will discuss the approach to handling EAI addresses and potential changes to the document text on the mailing list before deciding whether to return it to working group or to update it without the group.
*   **RDAP New Search Functionality:** Tom Harrison will consider adding text to the document clarifying that the more-specific domain name relation is primarily for reverse DNS.  The working group will discuss adoption on the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Chairs will follow up on the Simple Registration Reporting draft based on Jim Gould's feedback.
*   Chairs will initiate working group last call for the Redacted Fields document.
*   Jim Gould will publish a new version of the Internationalized Email Addresses document.
*   Working group members will review and comment on the updated Internationalized Email Addresses document on the mailing list.
*   Working group members will review and comment on the RDAP New Search Functionality document on the mailing list to determine next steps regarding adoption.
*   Mark will present the presentation regarding rdap for space objects to the mailing list for discussion.
