# scim

## Summary
The SCIM working group met to discuss several drafts and proposals.  Key topics included device onboarding using SCIM, roles and entitlements, referential values in schemas, cursor-based pagination, and upcoming work on HR schemas and a security BCP. Discussions focused on use cases, overlapping functionalities between different drafts, and potential solutions for efficiently synchronizing data.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SCIM for Devices (Elliot):**
    *   Discussion about provisioning and bootstrapping devices (e.g., IoT devices) using SCIM.
    *   Considered the suitability of SCIM versus other technologies like Netconf/RESTCONF/Yang for device description.
    *   Leif raised concerns from the Adrian community regarding Wi-Fi schemas and deployability challenges.
    *   Potential use cases for FIDO Device Onboarding and Matter were discussed.
*   **Use Cases Draft (Pam):**
    *   Question raised about the implementation and interpretation of external IDs and provisioning domains.
    *   Pam inquired whether different external IDs are mapped to different provisioning domains in existing implementations.
*   **SCIM Roles and Entitlements (Danny):**
    *   Draft proposes new roles and entitlements endpoints for clients to discover available values.
    *   Discussion on expanding roles/entitlements resources to include a members attribute.
    *   Clarification needed on the usage of sub-attributes (especially "type") within roles and entitlements.
    *   Consideration of prerequisites or conflicting relationships between roles/entitlements.
*   **Referential Value and Location (Danny):**
    *   Draft aims to define properties for attributes that accept values from a limited set, enabling discovery and automation.
    *   Dean suggested a need for filtering capabilities on referential values (e.g., only managers with a specific role).
    *   Pam raised security concerns related to callouts to foreign servers for referential values.
    *   Broader discussion on the need for new schema properties, such as cardinality for multi-valued attributes.
*   **Cursor-Based Pagination (Danny, on behalf of Matt Peterson):**
    *   Status update on the cursor-based pagination draft.
    *   Discussed the coexistence and overlap with the skim events draft and potential future Delta query mechanisms.
    *   Highlighted the benefits of cursor-based pagination for efficient retrieval of data, especially for initial data synchronization.
    *   Daryl suggested combining events with Delta query for improved reliability.
    *   Discussion about the need for synchronization use cases and potential solutions using a Watermark based system.
*   **Upcoming Work (Danny):**
    *   Human Resources Schema (standardizing worker/employee representation).
    *   Delta Query (efficient synchronization of changes).
    *   Security Best Current Practices (guidance on secure SCIM implementations).
    *   Reference Attribute URL Authorization (addressing authorization issues for reference URLs, like profile pictures).

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Elliot to contact Leif to discuss experiences with Wi-Fi schema.
*   **Action Item:** Pam to post her question regarding external IDs and provisioning domains on the mailing list.
*   **Action Item:** Danny to work with others on the discussion of referential values offline to determine if those values are able to be filtered.
*   **Action Item:** Danny and Matt to clarify the use cases for cursor-based pagination in the draft's introduction.
*   **Action Item:** Authors of the cursor-based pagination draft to prepare for a call for adoption.
*   **Action Item:** Danny to reach out for assistance on Delta query (Daryl volunteered).

## Next Steps

*   Continue providing feedback and comments on the drafts under discussion.
*   Progress work on the upcoming drafts: Human Resources schema, Delta query, Security BCP, and Reference Attribute URL Authorization.
*   A side meeting is scheduled for Wednesday at 4 PM local time (with Zoom option).
