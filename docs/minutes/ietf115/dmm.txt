## Summary

The DMM working group meeting covered several key topics related to mobile network architecture and transport. Presentations included updates on mobility slicing for 5G, srv6 user plane, integration of AN and UPF, SRv6 mobile user plane architecture, media header extensions, device identifiers, and GTP replacement with SRv6 or MPLS.  Significant discussion focused on the interaction and alignment with 3GPP specifications and the potential for IETF contributions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Mobility Slicing for 5G:** Terminology alignment with TEAS framework, clarification of relation to 3GPP functions, and consistency of text within the draft. Discussion on mapping 3GPP slices to IETF slices, specifically concerning NR slicing and allocation of ssai.
*   **SRv6 User Plane:** Status update on IETF last call, concerns about architectural conflict with 3GPP, and possible informational vs. proposed standard status. Review from 3GPP requested.
*   **Integrating AN and UPF:** A new proposal to integrate AN/CU and UPF into a single function for 6G.  Discussions on mobility handling, SMF interactions with UPF,  QoS considerations, potential for signaling simplification, impact on policy control architecture, and alignment with microservices architecture.
*   **SRv6 Mobile User Plane Architecture:** Update on the draft with illustration section structured in four sub-sections. Focus on deployment models and potential adoption as a working group document.
*   **Media Header Extensions for Wireless Networks:** Discussion on the need for metadata to address latency and bandwidth variations in wireless networks, potential metadata fields (priority, packet burst, delay budgets), and transport options (QUIC extensions, UDP options, mask encapsulation). Privacy concerns related to metadata exposure were raised.
*   **Cryptographically Generated Device Identifiers:** A proposal for a structure and semantics for device identification using cryptographic terms, with the goal of binding the identifier to the access network for policy enforcement.
*   **GTP Replacement with SRv6 or MPLS:** A discussion on replacing GTP tunneling under the hood with either SRv6 or MPLS in IP VPNs for traffic steering and bandwidth savings. Considerations for mapping QoS flows.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Mobility Slicing for 5G:** Solicit further reviews from the working group on the mailing list.
*   **SRv6 User Plane:** Await feedback from the 3GPP coordination team regarding architectural impact. Clarify the last call date and resend a reminder email.
*   **Integrating AN and UPF:** Bring the proposal to 3GPP for further discussion after gathering more feedback, especially from mobile operators. Clarify assumptions on multiple RRUs and cu. Add clarifying text to the presentation.
*   **SRv6 Mobile User Plane Architecture:** Continue to update and clarify the document. Collect interest to assess the appropriateness for working group adoption.
*   **Media Header Extensions for Wireless Networks:** Explore the option of application server providing metadata without being "leaky" regarding encryption.
*   **Cryptographically Generated Device Identifiers:** Awaiting feedback on the proposal.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussion on the mailing list for each topic.
*   Follow up with 3GPP on architectural concerns regarding the SRv6 user plane and integrated AN/UPF proposals.
*   Solicit working group reviews of the updated mobility slicing draft.
*   Present integrated AN/UPF proposal to 3GPP.
