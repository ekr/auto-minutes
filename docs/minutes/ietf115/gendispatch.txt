## Summary

This GenDispatch session focused on the relationship between the IETF and its trust, prompted by a draft document authored by Lars Eggert and Russ Housley.  The discussion centered on the document's purpose, scope, and the appropriate forum for continued discussion.  The discussion also touched on BCP 83 and potential updates to the IETF moderation mechanisms.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Scope and Purpose:**  The document aims to articulate community expectations regarding the trust's operations, but some attendees expressed concern about potentially overstepping into the trust's internal operational details.
*   **IETF vs. Broader Stakeholder Expectations:** A key question raised was whether the document should focus solely on IETF's expectations or encompass expectations from other stakeholders, such as IANA.
*   **Funding the Trust:** The discussion touched on the IETF LLC's role in fundraising for the trust and the need to ensure compliance with public support test requirements.
*   **Transparency and Openness:** There were suggestions for the trust to increase transparency, potentially through open meetings or regular communications.  The trust now has weekly office hours every Thursday at 1-2pm.
*   **Trustee Liability:**  Concerns were raised about the personal liability of trustees and how the trust's re-incorporation in Delaware might address these concerns.
*   **Working Group vs. Informal Liaison:** There were differing opinions on whether a formal working group was needed to address the issues raised, or if an informal liaison between the IETF and the trust would be sufficient.
*   **Moderation Mechanisms:** A suggestion was made to revisit BCP 83 and IETF's moderation mechanisms for participation channels, specifically addressing communication styles suitable for a global audience.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Document Revision:** Lars Eggert will revise the document to clarify its scope and purpose, focusing on articulating the IETF's needs from its trust.
*   **Further Discussion:** The community will consider whether to pursue a formal working group or an informal liaison to further explore the relationship between the IETF and the trust. Lars is around to chat.
*   **Moderation Mechanisms:** Braun will gather input and draft a proposal regarding updates to BCP 83 and IETF moderation mechanisms.

## Next Steps

*   Lars will solicit feedback on the updated draft document.
*   The GenDispatch chairs will assess the community's interest in forming a working group based on the revised document and broader discussion.
*   Braun will start the process to update BCP 83.
