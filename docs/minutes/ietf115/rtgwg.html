<h1>rtgwg Meeting Minutes</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The RTGWG meeting at IETF 115 covered updates on several drafts including QSCN model, SRv6 path protection, SRv6 midpoint protection, Generalized IPv6 Tunnel, and Blockchain applications in routing. The meeting also included a presentation and discussion on the SCION architecture. Discussions focused on technical details, interactions with other working groups (SPRING, 6MAN), and potential applicability of the proposed solutions.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>QSCN Model Updates:</strong> Discussion centered on clarifying the correlation of filters and their operation within classifiers and policy models. Young doctor comments addressed regarding inline classification.</li>
<li><strong>SRv6 Path Protection:</strong> The draft was reviewed in LSR but concerns were raised about the lack of SPRING review. The presenter clarified the intent is to address service protection. Key issue is whether it can be progressed within the group or should be taken to other working groups.</li>
<li><strong>SRv6 Egress Protection:</strong> Concerns were raised regarding the PSD Sid and its interaction with SPRING. Discussions highlighted the need for further clarity on the impact of the proposed Sid type and backwards compatibility. Concerns also about interaction with c-seed. The group agreed to continue the discussion on the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>SRv6 Midpoint Protection:</strong> The presenter mentioned changes made to the draft following review comments. However, participants highlighted the need for further discussion within SPRING and 6MAN regarding the modifications and potential loop scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Generalized IPv6 Tunnel:</strong> A new tunnel encapsulation was proposed. Concerns were raised about the necessity of defining new encapsulations and the potential for duplication of work done in other working groups like MPLS. Stakeholder feedback from MPLS and NVO needed.</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain Applications:</strong> The presentation explored potential uses of blockchain technology in routing protocols, particularly BGP. Suggestions included secure storage of configuration files and policy enforcement. Concerns were raised about the speed of blockchain and its suitability for control loops. Discussion of potential use cases focusing on proving ownership of address prefixes.</li>
<li><strong>SCION Architecture:</strong> An update on the SCION architecture was presented, including recently published internet drafts. The need for detailed service specifications and interworking with existing internet infrastructure was emphasized.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>SRv6 Path Protection:</strong> Authors to ensure the document is reviewed by the SPRING working group and address their comments.</li>
<li><strong>SRv6 Egress Protection:</strong> Authors to initiate discussions in SPRING and 6MAN about the PSD Sid and its implications. Authors to investigate interactions with c-seed.</li>
<li><strong>SRv6 Midpoint Protection:</strong> Authors to address comments raised, send an updated version of the draft to SPRING for review, and clarify the interaction with the IGV before convergence.</li>
<li><strong>Generalized IPv6 Tunnel:</strong> Authors to consult with the MPLS and NVO communities to gather feedback on the proposal and its potential impact.</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain Applications:</strong> Authors to identify a specific focus for the work and provide more concrete details.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors of drafts to address comments and feedback received during the meeting.</li>
<li>Drafts to be circulated to relevant working groups (SPRING, 6MAN) for review and discussion.</li>
<li>Further discussion on mailing lists to resolve open issues and questions.</li>
</ul>

<li>Alternative approach of using YANG models for configuration consistency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Routing on Service Addresses:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Transitioning from locator-based addressing to an addressing scheme that represents services.</li>
