## Summary
This meeting covered several topics including updates on existing drafts, a presentation on SVTA's work connecting professional media industry with IETF, a pilot deployment of ALTO in Telefonica's CDN, and a proposal for a tree-based CDN (treaty end) optimized for live streaming. The main focus was on discussing the inclusion of data and numbers in the AR traffic draft and considering the potential adoption of the treaty end draft as a working group item.

## Key Discussion Points
* **AR Traffic Workload Characteristics Draft:**
    *  Discussion on the validity and potential impact of including specific throughput and latency numbers.
    *  Concerns raised about uncompressed 4K video bandwidth requirements and alternative compression methods.
    *  Suggestion to use ranges/orders of magnitude instead of precise numbers.
    *  Need to specify the timeframe/technology generation for the numbers used.
    *  Discussion around different network architectures for computation offloading and issues that may arise between different kinds of technologies for wireless links.
* **SVTA Update:**
    * SVTA (Streaming Video Technology Alliance) has changed its name to svta (Streaming Video Technology Alliance).
    *  SVTA is cataloging key technologies from groups like the IETF.
    *  Updates on open cache configuration interface specification (version 1.1).
    *  Progress on a PLC at the svta attempting to take quick.
* **Telefonica ALTO Pilot:**
    *  Update on the ALTO deployment for integrating network topology for CDN optimization.
    *  Pilot deployed in a live network, preliminary analysis shared (good and not-so-good news).
    *  Next steps involve operationalization, debugging, and resolving OS support issues.
* **Tree-Based CDNs (treaty end):**
    *  Presentation on treaty end, an architecture optimized for live streaming using SSM (Source Specific Multicast) and AMT (Automatic Multicast Tunneling).
    *  Discussions about the democratizing nature of the technology, potential attack surfaces, content rights, and key management.
    *  Potential for MOPS to adopt the document.

## Decisions and Action Items
* **AR Traffic Workload Characteristics Draft:**
    * Include the numbers in the draft but specify the timeframe and technology generation.
    *  Consider using ranges/orders of magnitude.
    *  Address the questions raised to the mailing list to get answers.
* **Tree-Based CDNs (treaty end):**
    * Perform a hum to get a sense of the general interest for the working group.
    * Follow up on the mailing list to see about moving this forward.
## Next Steps
* **AR Traffic Workload Characteristics Draft:** Authors to revise draft based on feedback, including specifying timeframe for numbers and potentially using ranges/orders of magnitude. Post open questions to the mailing list.
* **Tree-Based CDNs (treaty end):** MOPS chairs to follow up with Lenny on potentially adopting the draft.  MOPS chairs will post to the mailing list to confirm interest.
