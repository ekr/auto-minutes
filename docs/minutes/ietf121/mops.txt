## Summary

This meeting covered updates on working group documents, a presentation on network overlay impacts, a presentation on Common Access Tokens (CAT), and an update from the Streaming Video Technology Alliance (SVTA). Discussions focused on clarifying problem statements in the network overlay draft, exploring potential solutions involving network topology exposure, the applications of CAT, and the ongoing collaboration between IETF and SVTA.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Network Overlay Impacts Draft:**
    *   Need to clarify problem statements regarding network overlays and their impact on video streaming.
    *   Seeking contributions from video service providers and network overlay product engineers.
    *   Discussion around exposing network topology and capabilities to aid CDN and cache selection.
*   **Common Access Token (CAT):**
    *   CAT aims to provide a common and extensible bearer token for content access across multiple CDNs.
    *   Benefits of using binary (CBOR) format for tokens to reduce size.
    *   CAT supports a wide range of claims for content protection and authorization, including geographic restrictions using GeoHash.
    *   Probabilistic rejection as a stateless mechanism to deter token sharing by pirates.
    *   Discussion on the privacy implications of geo-location data and when encryption is mandatory.
    *   Interoperability and the need for future standardization.
*   **SVTA Update:**
    *   SVTA focuses on operational aspects of streaming video technology.
    *   Significant overlap and collaboration between SVTA and IETF, especially in areas like CDNI, Quick, and DNS.
    *   DASH-IF has joined SVTA.
    *   Upcoming SVTA meetings to be held in conjunction with IETF meetings in Madrid and Montreal.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Network Overlay Impacts Draft:**
    *   Authors to clarify problem statements and incorporate feedback from the community.
*   **CAT Presentation:**
     * Presenters to address feedback on the size comparison between JSON Web Token and CWT.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to continue working on the Network Overlay Impacts draft and solicit feedback on the mailing list and GitHub.
*   Encourage review of the CAT specification (CTA 5,07).
*   Continued collaboration between IETF and SVTA.
