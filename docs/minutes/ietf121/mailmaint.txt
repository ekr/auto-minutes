# mailmaint

## Summary

The mailmaint working group meeting covered several topics including updates on the expires and Rungership recipient URL drafts, a presentation on AutoConfig, proposed work on SMTP UTF-8, new keyword registration, an OAuth profile for email, and an overview of DCIM2. The meeting focused on technical discussions and potential paths forward for each item.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Expires Draft:** Richard Clayton from Yahoo raised concerns about the draft's implementation feasibility. The group discussed clarifying the meaning of "expires" with non-normative text.
*   **Recipient URL Draft (Not Me):** Richard Clayton suggested combining the "unsubscribe" and "not me" functionalities. Discussion included semantic differences and the potential for a parameter within "list unsubscribe".
*   **Auto Config:** Ben presented an update on the AutoConfig draft, including the existing protocol as used by Matlans and a new proposal leveraging DNS. Questions arose about specifying XML formats in RFCs and ensuring DNS records are configurable.
*   **SMTP UTF-8:** Ernst presented on two documents aimed at relaxing and simplifying the SMTP UTF-8 implementation, specifically concerning local part syntax. Focus on ensuring safe rendering and cutting/pasting of addresses. Concerns were raised regarding single-script rule.
*   **Keyword Registration:** Neil presented on the need to register keywords used in email clients to avoid conflicts and facilitate interoperability. The group discussed the scope of registration and the need for clear semantics.
*   **OAuth Profile for Email:** Neil presented an OAuth profile proposal aimed at improving security and interoperability by removing reliance on username/password authentication. Discussion included client ID registration, the authorization code grant flow, and potential dependence on web browsers.
*   **DCIM2:** Bron presented an overview of DCIM2, which addresses replay attacks, backscatter, and other issues related to DKIM. Discussion included asynchronous spam scanning, modification algebra, and supporting indirect mail flows.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Expires Draft:** John to revise the expires draft to address Richard Clayton's concerns and update the milestone.
*   **Recipient URL Draft:** John to explore combining "unsubscribe" and "not me" functionalities and update the milestone.
*   **Auto Config:** Ben to include an XSD in the informational RFC.
*   **SMTP UTF-8:** Ernst to work with John and the group to decide if documents should be merged and take to list for working group adoption.
*   **Keyword Registration:** Neil to take to the list to see if it is desirable to combine into one document for gathering all existing uses of keywords.
*   **OAuth Profile for Email:** Take to list and see if there's interest in adopting this as a starting point and review discussion about possible dependence of web browser.
*   **DCIM2:** Discuss on the DEKIM list and start preparing a BOF, either an interim BOF or at the next IETF, and start a conversation with the IESG.

## Next Steps

*   Post revised drafts to the mailing list for review and comment.
*   Continue discussion on the mailing list for all topics.
*   Organize a BOF for DCIM2.
