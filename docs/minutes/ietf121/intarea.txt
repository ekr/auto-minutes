# intarea Meeting Minutes

## Summary

The intarea working group meeting covered several important topics, including updates on proxy configurations, ICMP extensions, reverse traceroute, W-pad specifications, multicast port assignments, and MACSec encryption. The discussion focused on clarifying existing drafts, addressing open issues, and determining the direction for future work.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Proxy Configurations (PVD):**
    *   Discussion on communicating proxy details in JSON format for provisioning domains.
    *   Parity with PAC files was analyzed, highlighting differences and potential omissions in PVD configurations.
    *   Debated including proxy authentication hints in the PVD configuration. Consensus leaned towards excluding it for now, possibly addressing it in a separate draft.
    *   Addressed concerns about very long lists of match and exclude domains in PVD JSON and how clients should handle them.
*   **ICMP Extensions:**
    *   Discussion on clarifying existing ICMP probing extensions due to implementation inconsistencies.
    *   Considered adoption of a draft fixing unclear text in ICMP extensions, specifically around checksum calculation and data inclusion.
    *   Presentation on extending node ID using ICMP extensions, including adding IP address and name sub-objects.
    *   Discussion on adding configurable security considerations to the draft, especially regarding CELAT translators.
*   **Reverse Traceroute:**
    *   Discussion on using ICMP for reverse traceroute signaling.
    *   Two main options: ICMP Echo vs. Extended Echo.
    *   Concerns raised about compatibility with legacy middleboxes and the impact of using new ICMP types.
    *   Discussion on stateless vs. stateful server implementations, with a suggestion to allow implementations to decide.
*   **Updated W-pad Specification:**
    *   Discussion on the new iteration of the W-pad spec and ways to make it less dangerous.
    *   Added URN to explicitly state that there is no proxy on the network
*   **Multicast Port Assignments:**
    *   Proposal to assign a UDP port specifically for multicast applications.
    *   Discussion about security implications, especially regarding the reuse add or flag, and potential differences in usage between ASM and SSM.
    *   Concerns about port number ranges that were already assigned.
    *   Direction to work with TSVWG and the IANA port team on assigning the ports.
*   **MACSec Encryption:**
    *   Discussion on modifying MACSec engines for various transport types (MPLS, SRv6) by programming authentication and encryption offsets.
    *   Highlighting the need for a new Security Channel Identifier (SCI) for IP and MPLS domains.
    *   The potential move the key distribution MKA, to the IP domain.
    *   Simultaneous progression with the IEEE was encouraged to align with the design.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **ICMP Extensions:** The chairs will add the ICMP extension clarification draft to the list for an adoption call.
*   **ICMP Extensions (Node ID):** The authors will update the draft based on feedback, particularly concerning security considerations and the inclusion of IP address and name sub-objects.
*   **Reverse Traceroute:** Authors to add ipv6 testing and scenarios, to to-do list.
*   **Multicast Port Assignments:** Authors to look for port ranges that have not been assigned yet. Authors to work with TSVWG and the IANA port team on assigning the ports.
*   **MACSec Encryption:** Authors to work with the IEEE to document the data flows and look at addressing the use of IPv6 addresses.

## Next Steps

*   Adoption call for the ICMP extension clarification draft.
*   Continued discussion on the mailing list regarding the open issues on all drafts presented.
*   Updates to drafts based on feedback received during the meeting.
