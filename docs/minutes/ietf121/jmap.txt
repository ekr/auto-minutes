## Summary
This JMAP session covered several topics, including updates on existing drafts related to calendars, contacts, and sharing, as well as discussions on portability, push notifications, file storage, and archive formats. The group discussed timelines for draft publication and adoption.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Portability Drafts:** Joris Baum provided an update on the three portability drafts (guide, REST, extensions). The Essential guide draft is nearly ready for working group last call (approximately 4 weeks).  The group discussed minimum J-MAP implementation and the session object.
*   **Tasks Draft:** The group discussed the JMAP Tasks draft, particularly the need for more feedback from task vendors and communities beyond traditional calendar/contact applications.  It was noted that this could fill a gap in portability for issue tracking systems.  The spec adds a bunch of new properties to the JS calendar object that may be seen as more than just API nuances.
*   **Push Notifications:** Neil presented a draft extension for push notifications that allows clients to filter pushes based on email query and request specific properties within the push request to avoid additional HTTP requests.
*   **File Node:** Bron presented a file node draft based on Fastmail's file storage implementation, covering topics such as symbolic links, parent nodes, capabilities, changing node content, and metadata properties. The group discussed the properties that should be available and calculated properties such as full path and calculated rights on the node.
*   **Archive Format:** The group briefly discussed the potential adoption of a document for JMAP archive format.
*   **Milestones:**  The group discussed and adjusted milestones for various drafts.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Portability Guide:** Publish a new version of the JMAP Essential portability guide.
*   **Portability Drafts:** Publish new versions of the other three portability specs.
*   **Tasks Draft:**  Post to the mailing list to solicit feedback from task vendors beyond traditional calendar/contact vendors.
*   **Push Notifications:** Neil will publish a draft extension for push notifications.
*   **File Node:**  Conduct a call for adoption for the file node draft. Bron to work on improvements to the file node draft based on the discussion including adding sub-object for file info with required keys (type, size, blobId).
*   **Archive Format:** Alexei to produce a first version of a JMAP archive format draft by March.
*   **Push Bappard:** Submit the push Bappard draft to Murray.

## Next Steps
*   The team will work on the actions identified above.
*   The next steps for each of the active drafts are listed in the updated milestone schedule.
