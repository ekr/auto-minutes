<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 05 Nov 2024 09:30</p>
<h1>rtgwg</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The RTGWG meeting at IETF 121 in Dublin covered several key topics, including rechartering the working group, updates on various drafts related to TI-LFA, BGP PIC, microloop avoidance, destination source routing, and AI networking. There were also presentations on new drafts concerning in-network congestion notification and adaptive routing framework. The meeting focused on refining existing drafts, discussing terminology, addressing comments, and exploring potential future work.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rechartering:</strong> The working group is formalizing ongoing work in areas such as satellite routing, routing in data centers, and networking in AI clusters. Feedback on the recharter is requested.</li>
<li><strong>TI-LFA Draft:</strong> Discussions centered on the use of &quot;should&quot; and &quot;key&quot; keywords, specifically regarding whether following the post-convergence path is mandatory. It needs clarification.</li>
<li><strong>BGP PIC Draft:</strong> There was a discussion about terminology consistency with existing BGP specifications, and whether new terms are ambiguously defined.</li>
<li><strong>Microloop Avoidance Draft:</strong> Questions were raised about the document's purpose, whether it introduces new interoperability extensions, and its relationship to existing RFCs.</li>
<li><strong>Destination Source Routing:</strong> The discussion point was around including end-host destination source routing.</li>
<li><strong>Pass-Aware Remote Protection:</strong> The discussion focused on the limitations of the current version on network architecture and why the failure notification protocol is BGP independent.</li>
<li><strong>Application and Network Collaboration:</strong> Scenarios were presented highlighting the importance of collaboration between applications and networks. The working group chair emphasized that future presentations should focus on work relevant to the working group.</li>
<li><strong>Routing in Computing Cluster Networks:</strong> The potential of hybrid routing approaches, combining distributed and centralized routing, was explored. The use of IGP in data centers was suggested as an alternative to BGP.</li>
<li><strong>In-Network Congestion Notification:</strong> It's a zero version draft. The document is about congestion notification between nodes instead of link failures.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive Routing Framework:</strong> An adaptive routing framework that aims to address load imbalances in AI networks was presented.</li>
<li><strong>Generalized IPv6 Tunnel:</strong> Draft intended to propose a more feature-proof and efficient mechanism by which to transport the advanced features within IPV6 headers.</li>
<li><strong>Fast Link State Advertisement:</strong> Proposed draft defines a link state advertisement protocol to notify the congestion status of the link.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TI-LFA Draft:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ahmed will work with Jim Guichard and John to resolve the &quot;key&quot; keyword discussion, including adding statements about why congruence may not be mandatory due to hardware limitations.</li>
<li>Address Stuart and Sasha's comments about re-evaluating whether the repair path has to be post-converged or provide clear justification for not requiring it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>BGP PIC Draft:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ahmed will send Jim Guichard a list of terms that are causing concern to aid in the review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Microloop Avoidance Draft:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Authors need to reference to existing RFCs and drafts that are more mature than the document to justify any of the key cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pass-Aware Remote Protection:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Authors need to address the points in the document about a three-level network, BGP correlation and the necessity of router ID loopback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fast Link State Advertisement:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Authors need to think about topologies that have a super spine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors of drafts to address comments and feedback received during the meeting and on the mailing list.</li>
<li>Further discussion on the rechartering document on the mailing list.</li>
<li>AIDC side meeting to be held on Thursday at 3 p.m.</li>
</ul>
