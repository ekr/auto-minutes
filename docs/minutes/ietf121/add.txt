## Summary

This meeting covered several topics including encrypted DNS server redirection, adding a new key to ResInfo for DNSSEC validation, and the status of a draft concerning provisioning certificates. The chair acknowledged technical difficulties at the start of the meeting, and there were active discussions on the utility and direction of specific drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Encrypted DNS Server Redirection (EDSR):** Tommy Jensen presented updates on the EDSR draft, including test results and an open question about advertising server support for EDSR in ResInfo. Opinions were solicited on whether to add a simple flag indicating EDSR support.
*   **ResInfo Key for DNSSEC Validation:** Stefan Barth presented a draft proposing adding a key to ResInfo to indicate DNSSEC validation. The discussion focused on the meaning of "specification required" in the registry policy and the appropriate level of detail (simple flag vs. more nuanced information) to include in the ResInfo. There was a general agreement on the utility of the goal, but specific questions regarding user applications.
*   **Draft on Certificate Provisioning:** The chairs discussed the status of a draft related to certificate provisioning for secure connections to encrypted resolvers. The draft had been updated to remove the certificate provisioning aspects, with that part now discussed in all dispatch. An interim meeting is planned to further discuss the ADD-specific aspects of the draft.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **EDSR:** Tommy Jensen to consider feedback on advertising EDSR support in ResInfo and continue end-to-end testing.
*   **ResInfo Key for DNSSEC Validation:** The working group will consider adopting the draft as a working group document to expedite its progress. Stefan Barth will take into account feedback regarding the granularity of the DNSSEC validation information.
*   **Draft on Certificate Provisioning:** An interim meeting will be scheduled, likely early in the new year, to discuss the direction of the draft after the all dispatch conversation progresses. Chairs will continue to monitor the all dispatch discussion.

## Next Steps

*   Schedule an interim meeting to discuss the certificate provisioning draft.
*   Tommy Jensen will update the EDSR draft based on feedback.
*   Stefan Barth will revise the DNSSEC validation ResInfo key draft considering feedback.
