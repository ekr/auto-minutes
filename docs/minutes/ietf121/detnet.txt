# detnet Meeting - IETF 112

## Summary

The detnet working group meeting at IETF 112 covered document status updates, liaison statements, discussion on data plane enhancements, and presentations on various individual draft proposals. The group discussed how to progress work on data plane enhancements and the selection criteria for queuing solutions. Updates were provided on the Control Plane Framework and Raw Architecture documents, both currently undergoing working group last call. Several individual contributions related to queuing and forwarding were presented.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Liaison Statements:** Discussion on responding to incoming liaison statements from ITU-T Study Group 13 and 5G ACI, including a request for feedback and a status update.  Also, the group discussed sending liaison statements to 3GPP and IEEE 802 regarding the raw technologies draft.
*   **Data Plane Enhancements:** Agreement on using the taxonomy document to identify categories of queuing solutions for further standardization efforts, with a focus on a limited number of solutions per category.
*   **Control Plane Framework:** Need for alignment with the Raw Architecture document, particularly regarding the "orientation function." The shepherd review is ongoing and contains important changes.
*   **Raw Architecture:** Emphasis on reliability and availability, integration with existing architecture and terminology.
*   **Taxonomy Document:** Discussion on whether strengths and weaknesses of individual solutions belong in the taxonomy document (consensus is no; should be a separate analysis).
*   **C-Score Draft:** Presentation on the C-Score queuing solution, with simulations on reference topologies. Discussion on latency bound and Jitter bound in the solution and state of the independent review of the mathematics.
*   **EDF and TQF Drafts:** Evaluation on high and light loading topology. Request for working group adoption.
*   **Policy-Based Jitter Control Draft:** Presentation of the framework to reduce the jitter. Avoid overlap with ADN framework.
*   **Resilient Cycle Queue and Forwarding:** Discussion on increasing data flow capacity
*   **Data Unit Group Draft:**  This is a mechanism to allow the knowledge of single application data unit to be transmitted across the IP packets.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Liaison Statements:**
    *   Send a response to ITU-T Study Group 13 and 5G ACI on the list.
    *   Send liaison statement to 3GPP.
    *   Working Group Chairs to inform IEEE 802 working groups about the Raw Technologies document.
*   **Control Plane Framework:** Authors to align with the Raw Architecture document and address comments from the shepherd review, list to be updated soon.
*   **Raw Architecture:** Pascal to publish next version of the draft with a summary of the changes and publish list.
*   **Taxonomy Document:** Jinou to work with authors and the working group to identify classes of queuing solutions and update the document accordingly.
*   **C-Score Draft:** Jinu to provide validation of expression on the list.
*   **Data Unit Group Draft:** Proposed extension should go through Six-man working group, because of lack of debtnet specific behavior.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of working group documents to address open issues and provide status updates on the mailing list and at future IETF meetings.
*   Working group to continue discussion on data plane enhancements and queuing solution selection on the mailing list.
*   Exploring the possibility of a joint meeting with the IEEE 802.1 TSN group, potentially in Madrid in July.
