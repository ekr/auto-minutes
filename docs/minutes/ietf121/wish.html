<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This meeting focused on progressing the WebRTC HTTP Ingestion Protocol (WEP) draft towards RFC publication. The main discussion points revolved around addressing open issues, particularly regarding server-sent offers, event stream handling, and extension mechanisms. Several actions were identified to move the document forward.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server-Sent Offers (Issue #12):</strong>  A significant discussion centered on whether WEP should support server-sent offers in addition to client-sent offers. Concerns were raised about the RESTfulness of server-sent offers, potential interoperability issues, and the lack of concrete proposals for implementation.  The main use case brought up was interoperability with whip.</li>
<li><strong>Event Stream Handling (Issue #19):</strong>  Julius proposed an alternative event stream architecture where the event stream is initiated before the WEP session, allowing for pre-session communication of information like simulcast envelopes.  Sergio expressed concerns about delaying RFC publication due to substantial redesign.  An alternative of using a data channel for events was brought up to avoid HTTP overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Extension Mechanism:</strong> Discussed the possibility of splitting the draft into a core WEP specification and an experimental extension specification for features like server-sent events and simulcast negotiation. An AD advised caution about experimental status. Agreement that a generic extension mechanism is important.</li>
<li><strong>Data Channels for Events:</strong> Discussed using data channels instead of HTTP for server-sent events, potentially alleviating HTTP-related overhead. Tim proposed modifying the current spec to be future-compatible with this by allowing the &quot;m=application&quot; line in the SDP offer, but instead of doing a 400 error, the client would just not include that M-line.</li>
<li><strong>URL Discoverability (Issue #7):</strong>  Discussed how to differentiate WEP URLs from other HTTP-based protocols, given that WEP uses HTTP URLs. The suggestion to use a &quot;.wep&quot; file extension was deemed impractical.</li>
<li><strong>Server Behavior for Misbehaving Clients (Issue #20):</strong>  Discussed whether the specification should define server behavior when a client requests an event that the server has not announced. It was determined that a one-sentence statement clarifying that the server is free to ignore or reject such requests would be beneficial.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server-Sent Offers:</strong>  The chairs requested a concrete proposal (PR) for server-sent offers. If no proposal is submitted within a reasonable timeframe, the issue will be closed. (Action: Open Issue #12 comment).</li>
<li><strong>Data Channels and Events:</strong> Tim will create a PR for supporting the M line today with data channel support to the spec and splitting the RFC into core WEP and the data channel extension RFC.</li>
<li><strong>Misbehaving Clients:</strong> A sentence clarifying server behavior when dealing with non-compliant clients will be added to the specification. (Action: Sergio to add the sentence).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tim to submit PR for data channel.</li>
<li>Sergio to add one sentence regarding non compliant clients.</li>
<li>Continue discussion on the mailing list to resolve open issues.</li>
<li>Sergio will backport all changes from HTTP review.</li>
</ul>
