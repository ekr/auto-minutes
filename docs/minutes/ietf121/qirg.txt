## Summary

The Quantum Internet Research Group (QIRG) meeting at IETF 121 focused on updates and presentations related to quantum networking research and development. Key topics included a reference framework for quantum internet architectures, quantum engineering for content connectivity, operational experiences with EuroQCI infrastructure, and the status of the Quantanet project.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Quantum Internet Reference Framework:** Diego presented an update on a draft proposing a reference framework for quantum internet architectures, emphasizing its role in analyzing and combining different architectural proposals. The framework aims to integrate quantum capabilities into the existing internet infrastructure rather than creating a separate quantum network.
*   **Quantum Engineering for Content Connectivity:** Marcello discussed the differences between classical and quantum networking, emphasizing the role of entanglement in shaping connectivity. He proposed a vision of interconnected quantum LANs (culans) managed by orchestrators and explored the manipulation of graph states to achieve dynamic connectivity.
*   **EuroQCI Infrastructure Deployment:** Piotr shared operational experiences from deploying the EuroQCI network in Poland, highlighting challenges in key management system (KMS) integration, fiber management, and environmental control. He emphasized the need for a dedicated management network and careful consideration of service channels for quantum communication devices.
*   **Quantanet Project:** Inder and Wenji presented an update on the Quantanet project, which focuses on building a three-node quantum computing testbed. Inder highlighted the need for quantum networking to connect multiple quantum computers and described a layered architecture for quantum networks, while Wenji detailed the control plane stack and two-level scheduler being developed for Quantanet.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Diego's Draft:** Participants are encouraged to review and provide feedback on Diego's draft proposing a reference framework for quantum internet architectures.
*   **Bangkok Meeting:** A QIRG meeting in Bangkok is likely, and an agenda will be discussed.

## Next Steps

*   Diego plans to release a version 03 of his draft with more details, incorporating feedback and addressing recent comments.
*   The Quantanet team will continue developing and testing their control plane stack and plans to release it to the community upon completion of internal tests.
*   Further discussion on quantum internet addressing and the standardization of physical layer protocols.
