## Summary

The NETCONF working group session at IETF 111 covered a packed agenda including updates on several drafts, discussion of new work items, and a presentation of an implementation report. Key topics included NETCONF over QUIC, private candidates, transaction IDs, list pagination, UDP client/server groupings, UDP notifications, configuration tracing, the IETF Yang Library, Yang Push enhancements, and a HCTPS Nodaf collector implementation.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **NETCONF over QUIC:** Discussion focused on implementation details, stream usage, and leveraging attacks from RFC 9250.
*   **Private Candidates:** The draft has been simplified by removing the private candidate NMDA data store. The main discussion point is whether resolution mode should be added to the commit operation.
*   **Transaction ID:**  Clarity around clock management and timestamps was addressed in the updated version.
*   **List Pagination:** Status of three drafts, already passed through one working with last core, and already implemented.
*   **UDP Client Server:** The group discussed the placement of groupings for QUIC client/server functionality. A poll favored keeping the groupings separate from the base UDP client/server draft.
*   **UDP Notifications:**  Discussion on the necessity of a default port and how clients can discover UDP Notif implementation.
*   **Configuration Tracing:**  The client is passed as an attribute of the RPC, aligning with the NetConf trust context extension.
*   **Augmented by in the IETF Yang Library:** Addresses how to find all of the YAM models in order to understand the YAM modules dependency list and which would when being applied to the connected to the rail routers
*   **Yang Push Transport Capabilities:** Discussed new document for encoding discoverable properties.
*   **Notif Envelope:** Discussed replacing notif yang and add brand new yang push header.
*   **Yang Push Observability:** Discussion of minimal viable push, remove some of the bells and whistle that are in yang push
*   **HCTPS Nodaf collector implementation** Report of implementations

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **List Pagination:** The AD will conclude the working group last call, and someone else will shepherd the document.
*   **Transaction ID:** Conclude the working group last call.
*   **UDP Client Server:** Focus on this and with one no opinion. start the working group last call after this meeting.
*   **UDP Notifications:** Chairs will discuss if working group last call and transport directorate review can proceed in parallel.
*   **Distributed Notifications:** Initiate working group last call.
*   **matthew quick client and quick servers:** Adopt the document after the meeting.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to address feedback and comments received during the session.
*   Chairs to schedule adoption calls and working group last calls where appropriate.
*   Continue discussion on the mailing list for open issues.
*   Hold virtual meetings for Yang Push observability between authors and interested parties
*   Consider adding metadata container to state which metadata is supported in the note for the New draft
*   Authors to explore incorporating HPS client server draft into the draft
