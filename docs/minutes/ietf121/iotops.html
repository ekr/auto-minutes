<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 07 Nov 2024 15:30</p>
<h1>iotops</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The IETF 121 iotops meeting covered updates on existing drafts, a discussion on rechartering the working group, and a discussion on device classes. Key topics included the comparison of co-op security protocols draft, proposed changes to the working group's charter, and the definition of device classes for IoT devices.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comparison of Co-op Security Protocols Draft:</strong> Updates to the draft include a reference to large TLS records with reduced overhead. Comments from Marco and Thomas are to be addressed shortly. The draft is considered stable, and the chairs will investigate the CTLS dependency.</li>
<li><strong>Rechartering Discussion:</strong> The proposed rechartering aims to allow the working group to produce standards track and BCP documents, particularly in areas like IoT-related certification. The discussion covered potential scope, collaboration with other working groups (e.g., chic, skim, ASDF), and the balance between tightly scoped work and broader discussions.</li>
<li><strong>CoreConf and Yang for IoT:</strong>  A discussion arose about whether IoT Ops is the appropriate place to discuss Yang and CoreConf for IoT. The conclusion was to submit specific proposals for documents that may be a good fit and the chairs can decide.</li>
<li><strong>Device Classes Draft:</strong> Discussion focused on the device class definitions and their applicability. There was debate on whether classes or tags would be a better approach and how to handle the evolving nature of device capabilities. The need for a good classification of devices was recognized. Several individuals volunteered to review the draft.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comparison of Co-op Security Protocols Draft:</strong> Address comments from Marco and Thomas and upload version 08. Chairs to investigate CTLS dependency.</li>
<li><strong>Rechartering:</strong> Post the first draft of the recharter proposal to the mailing list for further discussion and comment. Warren to take the proposal to SGNC informally to gauge support.</li>
<li><strong>Device Classes Draft:</strong> Solicit additional reviews of the device classes draft.  Explore the use of tags instead of classes for describing device capabilities. Add references to more elaborate categorization systems.</li>
<li><strong>Brendan's document:</strong> Chairs will talk to Brendan to find a good way forward for him and his document.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue discussion on the rechartering proposal on the mailing list.</li>
<li>Address comments and refine the device classes draft.</li>
<li>Authors to implement feedback to the drafts.</li>
</ul>
