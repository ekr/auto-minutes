<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 06 Nov 2024 11:45</p>
<h1>WG Chairs Forum</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This session focused on two key topics: working group surveys proposed by the IESG and presented by Jay Daley, and a presentation by Tim Wicinski on how the DNSOP working group manages workflow and transparency. The discussion on surveys revolved around the design, scope, and potential biases. The DNSOP presentation highlighted a GitHub-based issue tracker system for document management.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working Group Surveys:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The IESG wants better information about working groups via two surveys: one for working group participants and one for working group chairs.</li>
<li>The participants' survey aims to gauge working group performance and individual engagement, without directly evaluating chairs.</li>
<li>The chairs' survey seeks to understand their knowledge, expertise, personal impact, and attitudes towards chairing.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about potential biases in the participant survey, including normalization for group traffic, the impact of grudges, and self-selection.</li>
<li>Suggestions were made to include demographic information for meta-analysis, though concerns about anonymization were noted.</li>
<li>The number of questions was kept deliberately low and prioritisation was possible to encourage responses.</li>
<li>Potential difficulties of standardising questions across working groups with different workloads and levels of difficulty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>DNSOP Workflow Management:</strong>
<ul>
<li>DNSOP uses a GitHub-based issue tracker for transparency and task management.</li>
<li>The issue tracker helps to track documents and issues, assign responsibilities, and link documents to charter items.</li>
<li>The system integrates with GitHub's weekly email updates.</li>
<li>Consideration for working groups that have busy workflows and a need for transparent operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jay Daley (IETF Executive Director):</strong> Will review the survey questions, and the options for anonymous data collection and take feedback from this forum.</li>
<li><strong>Jay Daley and Jeffrey:</strong> To discuss demographic data collection for the participant survey offline.</li>
<li><strong>Participants:</strong> To send suggestions for topics for future WG Chairs Forum sessions to the mailing list or Richer Eye.</li>
<li><strong>Jay Daley:</strong> Look at working group chair training needs based on role areas of chairing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>The IESG will further refine the survey designs based on feedback from the WG Chairs Forum.</li>
<li>Jay Daley will continue to investigate the best approach to demographic data collection while preserving anonymity.</li>
<li>Tim Wicinski will continue to share the DNSOP workflow management system with other working groups.</li>
</ul>
