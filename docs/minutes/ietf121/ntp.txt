## Summary
The NTP working group meeting at IETF 121 covered updates on document progress, hackathon projects related to NTPv5 and Rough Time, and discussions on various NTP drafts including Share Requirements, NTPv5, Rough Time, NTS for PTP, and NTS extensions for enabling pools. The meeting also touched upon activities in IEEE 1588 (PTP) and planned future meetings and collaborations.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Document Progress:** The Registry document and the Enterprise Profile are in the RFC editor queue. NTP interleave modes needs an author update. NTP over PTP is awaiting a shepherd write-up.
*   **NTPv5 Hackathon Update:** Implementation is progressing; upgrade mechanism includes fallback to NTPv4. Feedback is welcome.
*   **Rough Time Hackathon Update:** Interoperability testing revealed bugs and security issues including insecure key generation and version downgrade attacks.
*   **Share Requirements Draft:** Approaching completion. Authors to be followed up with in the next few months.
*   **NTPv5 Draft:** New reap indicator and reference ID specifications. Review of SHOOT usage is needed. More review of the draft is needed from the WG.
*   **Rough Time Draft:** Security vulnerabilities related to key generation and version downgrade attacks were identified. Changes required to the draft, including guidance on secure key generation and mitigation for version downgrade attacks.
*   **NTS for PTP:** Implementation is progressing; major update planned for February. Collaboration with IEEE 1588 security working group is ongoing.
*   **NTS Extensions for Enabling Pools:** Experimentation is planned to assess feasibility. Concerns were raised about the computational load on the pool. Awaiting experimentation results before adoption.
*   **IEEE 1588 Activities:** Security working group is looking at NTS for PTP and authentication TLV issues. IEEE 1588.1 (CSPTP) is under development.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **NTPv5:** Working group to review the NTPv5 draft on github.
*   **Share Requirements Draft:** Chairs will follow up with the authors in the next few months.
*   **Rough Time Draft:** Marcus will write a digest of all the rough time security issues discovered and send it to the mailing list.
*   **NTS Extensions for Enabling Pools:** Await experimentation results before considering working group adoption.
*   **Security Directorate Review:** If the documents are ready, Eric is offering a security directorate review prior to working group last call, and IETF last call.

## Next Steps
*   Virtual interim meeting planned for January.
*   Joint call between NTP security and IEEE 1588 security groups planned for December.
*   Consider NTP Working Group meeting at the July IETF meeting in Europe for hackathon and testing activities.
