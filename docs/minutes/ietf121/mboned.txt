# mboned

## Summary

The mboned working group meeting covered several topics related to multicast deployment and new applications. Discussions included adaptive unicast to multicast forwarding, blockchain integration with IPv6 multicast, flexible multicast within QUIC, a survey on multicast support across operating systems, and bandwidth awareness in multicast. The group also discussed the adoption of several existing documents.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Adaptive Unicast to Multicast Forwarding:** Yisun presented a mechanism for unicast to multicast conversion in carrier networks to alleviate bandwidth pressure.  Discussion focused on its advantages compared to CDN solutions and clarification of use cases.
*   **Blockchain and IPv6 Multicast:** Jake from the BSV Association presented how the BSV blockchain leverages IPv6 multicast for micropayments and efficient node communication. The suitability of the mboned charter for related drafts was discussed.
*   **Flexible Multicast within QUIC:** Louis presented a draft proposing a way to integrate flexible multicast inside QUIC using multipath QUIC. The ability to fallback to unicast was highlighted.
*   **Survey on Multicast Support:** Max presented a survey on multicast support across operating systems, revealing inconsistencies in SSM implementation. They requested input on the reasons for lack of inter-domain multicast deployment.
*   **Bandwidth Awareness in Multicast:** Max briefly discussed integrating bandwidth awareness into multicast tree creation, seeking input on existing IETF efforts in this area.
*   **Multicast Snooping Optimization:** Nate previewed a PIM presentation on optimizing multicast snooping networks to prevent unnecessary stream forwarding.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Sandy to send an email to the chairs and the mailing list requesting a working group last call for the multicast Yang model and redundant ingress failover drafts.
*   **Action Item:** Jeffrey to send a message to the mailing list regarding the non-source routed SR draft requesting input and voicing the co-author's desire for adoption.
*   **Decision:** A draft discussing the benefits of using multicast for blockchain scenarios fits within the MBOD charter, pending review of the document's specifics.
*   **Action Item:** Yisun, Jake, Louis, and Max to share more information and details with the mailing list on all presentations discussed.
*   **Action Item:** Talus to look at the RFCs for socket API for SSM.

## Next Steps

*   Discussions on presented topics to continue on the mailing list.
*   Exploration of potential collaboration opportunities between mboned and other working groups (e.g., QUIC, PIM).
*   Progress on the drafting and submission of related documents, particularly on blockchain use cases.
