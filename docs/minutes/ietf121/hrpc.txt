## Summary
The Human Rights Protocol Considerations (HRPC) research group session at IETF 121 included updates on the intimate partner violence draft, a presentation on persona modeling in technology-facilitated interpersonal control, and a presentation on feminist helplines responding to online gender-based violence in Latin America. The session highlighted the complexities of technology use and misuse in human rights contexts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Intimate Partner Violence Draft:** Update on the IPV draft including narrowing the scope and clarifying that technologies are misused, not inherently attack vectors. Feedback from the mailing list has been incorporated, and further feedback, especially with supporting links to research or human rights organizations, is requested.
*   **Persona Modeling (IEEE):** Presentation on the IEEE working group on coercive technology-facilitated interpersonal control, focusing on persona modeling to understand threat actors and targets.  The group is creating an informational document. Discussion of applying persona modeling in the context of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and its relationship to traditional human rights violations. The use of card-based approaches for flexibility in modeling was discussed.
*   **Feminist Helplines:** Presentation on the work of feminist helplines in Latin America responding to online gender-based violence. Highlighted the importance of feminist methodologies, holistic approaches, and customized care plans.  Discussion of the usage of digital forensics for the attacks.  Most attacks reported are not technically advanced, often involving hacked accounts, stalking, and misuse of dual-use technologies. Also, discussion of how governments are misusing existing telecom technologies to track down people with no good intention.
*   **Dual-Use Technology:** Discussion around dual-use technology, specifically parental controls and encrypted messaging, and the challenge of balancing beneficial use with potential misuse by attackers.
*   **Need for Awareness:** Emphasis on the need for raising awareness about the challenges related to the use of technology by perpetrators of various types of abuse.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Intimate Partner Violence Draft:** Post the updated draft on the mailing list and solicit feedback, specifically requesting actionable research items, publications, or expansions for the document.
*   Sophia to send out a request for comments on the list.

## Next Steps

*   Follow up on the mailing list regarding the IPV draft.
*   Consider ways to bridge the gap between IETF standards development and human rights activism.
