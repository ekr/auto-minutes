## Summary

This DNS Service Discovery (dnssd) working group meeting covered several topics, including the status of SRP and Update Lease documents, multiple Q types, Time Stamping Records (TSR) for Advertising Proxy, DNS Push for Additional Data, SRP Compression for Constrained Networks, and the use of SVCB records with DNS-SD for custom services. The meeting also included a farewell to outgoing chair David Waitzman and a welcome to new chair Florian.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **SRP and Update Lease:** The documents are in RFC Editor queue (Auth48). Update Lease requires further review due to substantial editorial changes by the RFC Editor. SRP changes are less significant and should be completed soon.
*   **Multiple Q Types:** Discussion focused on clarifying valid Q types and the need for more implementation experience. There was a call for implementers to test the specification.
*   **TSR for Advertising Proxy:**  Ted Lemon presented an update on TSR and the need for API changes to handle transactional updates. There was a discussion about the scope of the API changes and whether they should be documented within the TSR or Advertising Proxy documents.
*   **DNS Push for Additional Data:** Ted Lemon provided an update on using DNS Push to replace MDNS in certain scenarios and how to deliver additional data alongside.
*   **SRP Compression for Constrained Networks:** Abtin Keshavarzian presented a proposal for compressing SRP messages, particularly for thread networks. There was discussion on the scope of this compression mechanism.
*   **SVCB Records with DNS-SD:** Gautam Akivate presented a scenario where SVCB records could be used to signal support for HTTP/3 and other protocols for custom services discovered via DNS-SD. This prompted discussion about the best approach and the appropriate working group for future work.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **SRP and Update Lease:** Circulate Auth48 changes to the working group list for review.
*   **Multiple Q Types:** Postpone Working Group Last Call until there is more implementation experience. Encourage implementers to test and provide feedback. Host a hackathon at the next meeting to encourage implementation. Ray will provide examples for review and consider incorporation into the text.
*   **TSR for Advertising Proxy:**  Take to the mailing list for a formal adoption call. Solicit co-author to help in the process.
*   **SVCB Records with DNS-SD:** The team will write up the proposals in a document with more details for further discussion on the mailing list to determine scope and next steps.

## Next Steps

*   **SRP and Update Lease:** Send updated documents to the RFC Editor after working group review.
*   **Multiple Q Types:**  Encourage implementations and provide feedback. Schedule a hackathon at IETF 122.
*   **TSR for Advertising Proxy:** Formal adoption call on the mailing list. Recruit co-author.
*   **DNS Push for Additional Data:** Update the document and share with the working group.
*   **SRP Compression for Constrained Networks:** Abtin to proceed with adoption within the Thread specification and continue discussions on the mailing list.
*   **SVCB Records with DNS-SD:** Draft a document outlining the proposal and circulate to the list for discussion.
*   Working group to review the Anima document with a DNSD component that will be shared by the MAVEN RG.
