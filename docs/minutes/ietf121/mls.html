<h1>mls</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The MLS working group meeting focused on extensions to the MLS protocol, aiming to prioritize and triage them effectively. Discussions covered various topics, including extension frameworks, post-quantum combiners, light clients, split commits, associated parties, semi-private messaging, and alternative AAD handling. Several proposals were presented, and feedback was solicited from the group regarding adoption and further development.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extension Prioritization:</strong> The main goal is to determine which extensions to focus on and how to prioritize them.</li>
<li><strong>Extension Definitions:</strong> Clarifying the definition of &quot;extension&quot; in MLS to avoid ambiguity (IANA registry vs. any non-main spec draft vs. a component being extended).</li>
<li><strong>Safe Extensions Framework:</strong> Concerns about the complexity and potential issues with the Safe Extensions framework, particularly regarding security boundaries and multiple extensions. Alternative approaches were discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Quantum Combiners (PQ Combiners):</strong>  Discussion of a hybrid approach combining post-quantum and traditional cryptography, offering flexibility in ratcheting and trading off between confidentiality and authenticity.</li>
<li><strong>Light Clients:</strong> Presenting the concept of light clients, which join MLS groups faster by downloading only a portion of the tree, with tradeoffs in authentication. Security concerns and potential misinterpretations were emphasized.</li>
<li><strong>Split Commits:</strong> Presenting split commits to reduce commit sizes for individual clients, involving a third party that personalizes the commit message, removing the need to broadcast the entire update path.</li>
<li><strong>Associated Parties:</strong> Extension for sharing key material with external parties. Concerns about complexity were raised and discussion of the possibility of simplification.</li>
<li><strong>Semi-Private Messaging:</strong> Key discussion regarding the use of associated parties for semi-private messages.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Authenticated Data (AAD):</strong> Discussing ways to authenticate data that is not part of the message, including stripping the AAD field.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item (Richard Barnes):</strong> File an issue elaborating on concerns regarding the Safe Extensions framework and propose an alternative.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Chairs):</strong> Schedule virtual interims to discuss extension frameworks and associated parties, and adoption consideration for semi-private messaging, ideally with a side-by-side comparison of associated parties use vs standalone.</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Schedule a working group adoption call for PQ combiners.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Joelle):</strong> Update terminology in the split commits draft to reflect &quot;split commits&quot; instead of earlier terms, and for Marta Mularchic and Joelle Alwen to re-read private messaging draft with associated parties, and update slides accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Richard Barnes):</strong> Flesh out the security considerations section for the light clients draft, adding warning labels and examples of appropriate and inappropriate use cases, include this with a light MLS red light emoji to highlight its dangers</li>
<li><strong>Action Item (Raphael):</strong> Look at the issue if need separate secret trees</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Schedule virtual interims to discuss extension frameworks, light clients, associated parties, and semi-private messaging.</li>
<li>Review and refine the light clients draft based on feedback, focusing on security considerations and appropriate use cases.</li>
<li>Prepare for the working group adoption call for PQ combiners.</li>
<li>Working group adoption call for PQ combiners</li>
