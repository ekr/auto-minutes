## Summary
The RTGWG meeting at IETF 121 in Dublin covered several key topics, including rechartering the working group, updates on various drafts related to TI-LFA, BGP PIC, microloop avoidance, destination source routing, and AI networking. There were also presentations on new drafts concerning in-network congestion notification and adaptive routing framework. The meeting focused on refining existing drafts, discussing terminology, addressing comments, and exploring potential future work.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **Rechartering:** The working group is formalizing ongoing work in areas such as satellite routing, routing in data centers, and networking in AI clusters. Feedback on the recharter is requested.
*   **TI-LFA Draft:** Discussions centered on the use of "should" and "key" keywords, specifically regarding whether following the post-convergence path is mandatory. It needs clarification.
*   **BGP PIC Draft:** There was a discussion about terminology consistency with existing BGP specifications, and whether new terms are ambiguously defined.
*   **Microloop Avoidance Draft:** Questions were raised about the document's purpose, whether it introduces new interoperability extensions, and its relationship to existing RFCs.
*   **Destination Source Routing:** The discussion point was around including end-host destination source routing.
*   **Pass-Aware Remote Protection:** The discussion focused on the limitations of the current version on network architecture and why the failure notification protocol is BGP independent.
*   **Application and Network Collaboration:** Scenarios were presented highlighting the importance of collaboration between applications and networks. The working group chair emphasized that future presentations should focus on work relevant to the working group.
*   **Routing in Computing Cluster Networks:** The potential of hybrid routing approaches, combining distributed and centralized routing, was explored. The use of IGP in data centers was suggested as an alternative to BGP.
*   **In-Network Congestion Notification:** It's a zero version draft. The document is about congestion notification between nodes instead of link failures.
*   **Adaptive Routing Framework:** An adaptive routing framework that aims to address load imbalances in AI networks was presented.
*   **Generalized IPv6 Tunnel:** Draft intended to propose a more feature-proof and efficient mechanism by which to transport the advanced features within IPV6 headers.
*   **Fast Link State Advertisement:** Proposed draft defines a link state advertisement protocol to notify the congestion status of the link.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **TI-LFA Draft:**
    *   Ahmed will work with Jim Guichard and John to resolve the "key" keyword discussion, including adding statements about why congruence may not be mandatory due to hardware limitations.
    *   Address Stuart and Sasha's comments about re-evaluating whether the repair path has to be post-converged or provide clear justification for not requiring it.
*   **BGP PIC Draft:**
    *   Ahmed will send Jim Guichard a list of terms that are causing concern to aid in the review.
*   **Microloop Avoidance Draft:**
    *   Authors need to reference to existing RFCs and drafts that are more mature than the document to justify any of the key cases.
*   **Pass-Aware Remote Protection:**
    *   Authors need to address the points in the document about a three-level network, BGP correlation and the necessity of router ID loopback.
*   **Fast Link State Advertisement:**
    *   Authors need to think about topologies that have a super spine.

## Next Steps
*   Authors of drafts to address comments and feedback received during the meeting and on the mailing list.
*   Further discussion on the rechartering document on the mailing list.
*   AIDC side meeting to be held on Thursday at 3 p.m.
