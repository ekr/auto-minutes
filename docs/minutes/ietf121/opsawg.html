<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 06 Nov 2024 09:30</p>
<h1>opsawg</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The OPSAWG meeting covered a variety of topics, including updates on documents in last call, working group document adoption proposals, and discussions regarding information and data modeling. The meeting also featured presentations on contributed work related to network diagnosis, prefix assignment advertisement, DDoS mitigation, and network device security posture. The ops area section included NEMOPS updates and discussions.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Packet Discard Draft:</strong> Discussion on the information model versus data model debate, specifically related to the use of Yang for expressing the information model.  Concerns were raised regarding IANA registration for information models if data manipulation is not intended.  A suggestion was made to move towards defining a data model instead.</li>
<li><strong>Data Manifest for Telemetry:</strong> The draft is ready for last call. Dependencies on young schema were removed and replaced with schema-mount.</li>
<li><strong>IPFIX with GTP-U Draft:</strong>  Work is ready for publication. INA ports were added, and operational concerns for deployment were included.</li>
<li><strong>Network Diagnosis by Scheduling OAM Tests:</strong> Discussion on potential adoption of the draft, using existing YANG models and adding scheduling capabilities.  Interest was expressed, leading to a decision to proceed towards adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Prefix Advertisement Drafts (Prefix Length &amp; External References):</strong> Discussion on the need for such advertisements, especially for IPv6. Concerns were raised regarding redundancy with existing RIR registration principles and the potential for inaccurate information.</li>
<li><strong>SAF Based Anti-DDoS Architecture:</strong> The presenters sought feedback on the practical application of the architecture. The importance of building a community around the effort was highlighted.  It may be more appropriate to present in NMRG.</li>
<li><strong>Network Device Security Posture Model &amp; Configuration Modeling:</strong> Presentation on drafts related to monitoring and managing network device threat surfaces and security configurations. A question was raised on whether the working group or another working group (e.g., Mud, Sackham) is a more appropriate venue.</li>
<li><strong>Compute and Communication Resource Characterization:</strong> Discussion on defining compute models and metrics for informed workload placement decisions in distributed systems.  The scope of the work was discussed in relation to the CATS working group and broader use cases. The bottom-up approach was deemed reasonable.</li>
<li><strong>Intent-Based Security Management Automation &amp; Interface to In-Network Function:</strong> The presenter sought feedback on the potential for standardization and a request to adopt two drafts related to security management automation and analytics.</li>
<li><strong>PCAP Updates:</strong> Discussion on PCAP link types, PCAP itself, and PCAP NG (new generation). IANA requirements were discussed, as well as the next steps needed to progress PCAP Link Types.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Packet Discard Draft:</strong>  Authors to consider moving towards defining a data model.</li>
<li><strong>Data Manifest for Telemetry:</strong> Prepare for working group last call.</li>
<li><strong>IPFIX with GTP-U Draft:</strong>  Ready to move forward to publication.</li>
<li><strong>Network Diagnosis by Scheduling OAM Tests:</strong> Proceed towards adoption based on expressed interest.</li>
<li><strong>Prefix Advertisement Drafts:</strong> Further discussion on the list to gauge interest and address concerns.</li>
<li><strong>SAF Based Anti-DDoS Architecture:</strong>  Authors to consider NMRG presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Compute and Communication Resource Characterization:</strong> To work together with the CATS WG and consider other use cases.</li>
<li><strong>PCAP Updates:</strong> Michael to talk to IANA. Authors will restructure the long list to stanzas and prepare for working group last call.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to revise documents based on feedback.</li>
<li>Continue discussions on mailing lists.</li>
<li>Authors to address any remaining open issues identified.</li>
<li>Move drafts to Working Group Last Call where appropriate.</li>
<li>Continue coordination with related working groups (e.g., CATS).</li>
<li>Follow up on NEMOPS workshop organization.</li>
</ul>
