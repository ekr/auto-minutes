## Summary

This meeting covered several important CDNI topics, including capacity insight, handling third-party dependencies, rechartering considerations, updates on the CI control interface and triggers, named footprints, edge control metadata, new API proposals, and cache management. A key decision was made to move forward with drafts referencing third-party dependencies, following a poll of the working group. Discussion about rechartering the working group to accommodate processing stages and metadata extension language was initiated.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Capacity Insight (RFC 9677):** Updates provided on the document's status, currently awaiting IESG telechat review. Encouragement for AD reviewers to examine the document was reiterated.
*   **Third-Party Dependencies (Protected Secrets, Logging):**
    *   Discussion centered on referencing third-party technologies like HashiCorp Vault, AWS S3, and Kafka in IETF drafts.
    *   Concerns were raised about normative dependencies on proprietary technologies and version control.
    *   A poll was conducted, and the working group decided to move forward with including third-party dependencies, acknowledging the need for thorough review.
*   **Rechartering (Processing Stages, Metadata Extension Language):**
    *   Discussion initiated on the need to recharter to include work on processing stages (content mutation/creation) and a metadata extension language (MEL).
    *   Concerns were raised about defining "general purpose" templating languages and accidentally exceeding the group charter.
    *   A decision was made to refine charter language on the mailing list to better define what the group *will* do, rather than focusing on what it won't.
*   **CI Control Interface and Triggers (draft-ietf-cdni-control-v2):**
    *   Updates provided on version 15, including the migration towards a more RESTful design.
    *   Discussion of significant changes to the specification of the document, namely unification of CI objects.
    *   Clarification on the handling of purge requests during content acquisition.
    *   A strong plea was made for increased review of the document.
*   **Named Footprints (draft-ietf-cdni-named-footprint):**
    *   Discussion of restructuring the draft to separate the data model from the interface.
    *   A new draft will be created to define a restful interface for named footprints. The draft will rely on prior works.
    *   The use of MEL within named footprints was discussed, potentially requiring MEL extensions.
*   **Edge Control Metadata (draft-matsumoto-cdni-edge-control-metadata):**
    *   Version 3 will be uploaded which refers directly to RFC 806.
    *   Discussion to include a single example for each section in the document to provide clarity. The decision was to maintain the examples after the sections.
    *   Group was asked if it was ready for last call of the document.
*   **HTTP Rest API Proposal:**
    *   Proposal for a new draft about HTTP REST APIs in CDNI. This proposal bases on a push model instead of a pull model like the actual one.
*   **Extending Request Routing Redirection Interface:**
    *   Proposal for a new draft for expanding the capabilities that have been defaulted in 7975 in RFC related to request routing redirection. This interface is about adding redirection features.
*   **Cache Management Interface:**
    *   Discussed plans for the evolution of the Cash Management Interface work.
    *   Execution policy objectively support the FCA option to support separate management of metadata and content.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** Move forward with drafts referencing third-party dependencies (Protected Secrets, Logging), with the understanding that thorough review is crucial.
    *   **Action Item:** Ben to continue working on the drafts, incorporating feedback from the mailing list and reviews.
    *   **Action Item:** Francesca to ensure the decision regarding third-party dependencies is clearly documented in the shepherd write-up for both drafts.
    *   **Action Item:** Participants urged to review the Protected Secrets and Logging drafts.
*   **Decision:** Refine charter language for rechartering considerations (Processing Stages, Metadata Extension Language) on the mailing list.
    *   **Action Item:** Chris Lemmons to refine the charter language based on meeting feedback and bring it to the mailing list for further discussion.
*   **Action Item:** Jay and Alan to incorporate the new requirements for version 16 of the `draft-ietf-cdni-control-v2` draft.
*   **Action Item:** Alan and Jay must include better explanation the rationate behind this draft.
*   **Action Item:** Alfonso to upload version 3 of `draft-matsumoto-cdni-edge-control-metadata` which refers directly to RFC 806.
*   **Action Item:** Guillaume, begin creation of the HTTP REST APIs in CDNI draft.
*   **Action Item:** Guillaume, begin creation of the Extending Request Routing Redirection Interface draft.
*   **Action Item:** Alan, be sure to read the HECHBEST cash group working draft.
*   **Action Item:** Participants consider volunteering as document shepherds.

## Next Steps

*   Continued discussion on the mailing list regarding charter language refinement.
*   Focus on reviewing existing drafts, especially Protected Secrets, Logging, and CI Control Interface and Triggers.
*   Alan will post a recap summary of the recent meetings.
