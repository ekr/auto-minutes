## Summary
The MANET working group meeting covered draft statuses, presentations on new technologies, and discussion of the working group charter. Key discussions revolved around the progress of credit-based flow control drafts, potential new work items related to connecting MANETs to the internet, Kademlia-based routing (Kira), and Babel routing within 802.11 mesh networks.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Credit-Based Flow Control Drafts:** The authors are overloaded and the chairs are helping to move these drafts forward by addressing area directorate comments.
*   **Individual Drafts by Henning Rogge:**  Review and comments are needed. Don has already commented on some of them and the chairs will follow up and review the radio quality draft.
*   **MANET Internetworking:** Fred presented on using Arrow and Omni interfaces to connect MANETs to the internet. Rick Taylor questioned the need for a separate addressing scheme and suggested leveraging existing IPv6 mechanisms.
*   **Kademlia Directed ID Based Routing Architecture (Kira):** Roland presented Kira as a scalable, zero-touch routing architecture for control planes. Rick Taylor expressed enthusiasm for the technology.  A side meeting was scheduled to dive deeper into the technology.
*   **Babel for 802.11 Mesh:** Don Eastlake presented on using Babel as a path selection protocol within 802.11 mesh networks.  The discussion covered the benefits of using Babel in this context and the need for a draft RFC specifying how to use Babel within 802.11 mesh, and its suitability within the IETF.
*   **Charter Discussion:** The working group reviewed the current draft charter, discussing potential additions and modifications.  Concerns were raised about energy levels for certain work items, specifically DLIP.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Chairs to address area directorate comments on credit-based flow control drafts and generate new versions.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs to review Henning Rogge's drafts, specifically the radio quality draft.
*   **Action Item:** Fred to provide a paragraph of text for the charter related to MANET internetworking.
*   **Decision:** Support in the draft charter for Babel maintenance and development was supported.
*   **Decision:** The revised charter line should be narrowly scoped into things that are appropriate to be doing in the IETF.
## Next Steps

*   Continue addressing comments on credit-based flow control drafts and publish new versions.
*   Review and comment on Henning Rogge's individual drafts.
*   Further discussion of the charter text on the mailing list.
*   Attend the side meeting about Kira.
*   Consider how to frame a draft charter regarding Babel routing within 802.11 mesh.
