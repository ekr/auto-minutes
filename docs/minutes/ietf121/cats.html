<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The CATS working group meeting focused on refining the scope and direction of ongoing work, particularly concerning use cases, requirements, and metrics. Discussions centered around clarifying existing documents, merging overlapping efforts, and identifying key areas for future development. Individual draft submissions were reviewed, with an emphasis on ensuring alignment with the working group charter and ongoing efforts.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Several new Internet Drafts proposing use cases were discussed. The importance of coordinating with editors of the existing use case draft was emphasized to avoid overlap and consolidate efforts. The goal is to have one comprehensive use case document.</li>
<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Clarification and potential improvements to existing requirements were discussed. Proposals included combining requirements, refining terminology, and addressing specific use cases like computing-aware digital twins. A new requirement regarding consistent forwarding in instantiating technologies was proposed.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics:</strong> A hierarchical three-level model for CATS metrics was presented, with a focus on defining both compute and network metrics. Discussions centered around metric collection, distribution, assessment, and updates. The working group agreed to focus on Level 2 metrics for the immediate goal of the metrics milestone.</li>
<li><strong>Individual Drafts:</strong> Several individual drafts were presented, including those related to ORAN, 3GPP enhanced edge computing, ITS use cases, security considerations, and BGP extensions. The working group discussed how these drafts could potentially contribute to existing documents or inform future work.</li>
<li><strong>Framework Update:</strong> An update on the framework document was provided, highlighting changes and modifications made since the previous meeting. The group discussed new use cases impacting the framework and the need to consider OAM in requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Authors of individual use case drafts are to coordinate with editors of the existing use case draft to identify areas for merging and collaboration.</li>
<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Authors to consider feedback on the current requirements and propose revised text on the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics:</strong> The two teams will collaborate on a new revision of the draft (draft-key).</li>
<li><strong>Framework:</strong> Authors to review new use cases proposed and assess the impact on the framework architecture.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to revise their respective drafts based on the feedback received during the meeting.</li>
<li>Further discussions on requirements and potential improvements to take place on the mailing list.</li>
<li>Authors to integrate appropriate aspects of the presented drafts into the framework document</li>
<li>New version of the draft-key to be created with merged metrics concepts</li>
</ul>
