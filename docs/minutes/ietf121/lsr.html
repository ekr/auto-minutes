<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 07 Nov 2024 09:30</p>
<h1>LSR Session</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The LSR session covered several topics, including updates on existing drafts, presentations on new proposals related to OSPF, ISIS, and distributed flooding, and discussions on the applicability and potential adoption of these proposals. Key topics included advertising infinity links in OSPF, excluding nodes in Flex Algo, timestamping enhancements, distributed flooding optimization, and source address validation (SAV).</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advertising Infinity Links in OSPF:</strong> Updates were presented on the draft for advertising infinity links in OSPF.  A key discussion point was its interaction with overload simulation and compatibility with existing mechanisms. The use of the infinite metric was also justified with alignment to ISIS and easier adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Excluding Nodes in Flex Algo:</strong> A new method using admin tags for excluding nodes in Flex Algo was presented. The discussion focused on whether this approach offers advantages over existing participation mechanisms and whether it simplifies deployment in specific scenarios. Concerns were raised about the operational advantages.</li>
<li><strong>Timestamp Draft:</strong> Updates were given on the timestamp draft, including moving to the NPP epoch, increasing timestamp precision, and limiting maximum clock slip. An adoption call was planned.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed Flooding (Distopper):</strong> The presentation focused on consensus reached on key aspects of distopper deployment, and the minimal deployment configurations to get benefits from distopper. Discussion focused on operational considerations, migration strategies with respect to node update scenarios, and whether the working group should pursue leaderless operation.</li>
<li><strong>Flex Algo Data Plane:</strong> A new data plane for flex-algo with simple IP forwarding was proposed. The group had a brief discussion about why this capability was necessary and how it would work in an IP network.</li>
<li><strong>Source Address Validation (SAV):</strong> Two presentations discussed SAV intradomain and interdomain solutions. Discussions revolved around applicability, deployment models and the necessity of tagging prefixes in the IGP. Concerns about external networks in the IGP.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timestamp Draft:</strong> An adoption call will be scheduled after attendees had time to read the latest version of the draft.</li>
<li><strong>Excluding Nodes in Flex Algo:</strong> Authors were asked to clarify use cases and benefits on the mailing list.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed Flooding (Distopper):</strong> Decision on working group focus (leaderless operation) to be discussed on the mailing list to determine whether to put cycles in this area. No adoption call.</li>
<li><strong>SAV drafts</strong>: No adoption call. Awaiting stability in Savonet working group.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors should update drafts based on the feedback received during the session and on the mailing list.</li>
<li>The working group will discuss the future direction of leaderless operation for distributed flooding optimization on the mailing list.</li>
<li>The working group will await stability in the Savonet architecture before discussing adopting any intradomain or interdomain SAV related topics.</li>
</ul>
