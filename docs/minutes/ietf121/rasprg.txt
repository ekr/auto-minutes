## Summary

The rasprg meeting covered a range of topics related to standardization processes and participation. Presentations included analysis of geographic factors affecting participation, tools for exploring data from the Datatracker, automated report generation using AI, and an exploration of IETF's regenerative patterns and practices.  The discussions following each presentation focused on methodology, data normalization, and potential improvements to IETF processes.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Geography and Participation:** The role of geographic distance on participation in IETF and 3GPP meetings was analyzed, highlighting the impact on women's participation and the effects of remote participation options.
*   **Data Analysis Tools:** Tools developed for analyzing IETF data, including document statistics, author affiliations, and social graph analysis were presented. Challenges in data collection and entity resolution were discussed.
*   **Automated Report Generation:** The use of AI for automating IETF working group report generation was demonstrated, including the challenges of hallucinations and the use of various data sources.
*   **IETF's Patterns and Practices:** An examination of IETF's legislative processes, governance structures, and community dynamics using pattern languages was shared, highlighting positive attributes and potential areas for improvement.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Jusus Barron to consider time zones and visa requirements when evaluating the cost of travel for future studies.
*   **Action Item:** Jusus Barron to explore the IETF Datatracker for more granular data on gender and geographic location.
*   **Action Item:** Rio Janajit to explore sharing entity resolution code with the research group.
*   **Action Item:** Rio Janajit to explore pre-normalizing data with the IETF to remove redundant work.

## Next Steps

*   Explore ways to normalize IETF data to ease analysis across studies.
*   Continue refining AI-driven report generation tools.
*   Further investigate the impact of remote participation on diversity and inclusion.
*   Consider analyzing anti-patterns within the IETF to improve processes.
