# icnrg Meeting Minutes

## Summary

The ICNRG meeting covered several key topics including updates on the Flick draft, CCNX content object chunking, reflexive forwarding, ICN challenges for Metaverse interoperability, and distributed microservice communication. The discussion included progress updates, implementation challenges, and potential future directions for research.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Flick Draft:** Mark provided an update on the Flick draft, highlighting minor tweaks and updates based on implementation efforts. Finalization of the draft is impending once the external implementation is complete, and testing on C4 is performed.
*   **CCNX Content Object Chunking:** Mark presented a proposal for chunking and segmentation in CCNX, based on an older draft. The discussion covered chunk ID consistency and the potential need for variable chunk sizes. The group agreed to an adoption call on the mailing list.
*   **Reflexive Forwarding:** Dave provided a recap of reflexive forwarding concepts, followed by Hitoshi's presentation on recent changes and implementation details in C4. The discussion addressed terminology, TLV definitions, message exchange flows, and pit entry management. Open issues and to-dos were also discussed.
*   **ICN Challenges for Metaverse Interoperability:** Jungha presented a draft exploring ICN's potential in addressing interoperability challenges for Metaverse platforms. Key benefits and challenges were discussed, with potential solutions proposed.
*   **Distributed Microservice Communication:** Aijun Wang discussed requirements for distributed microservices from the cloud, introducing the concept of service mesh and its challenges. A distributed architecture based on ICN was proposed, along with a vision for future IETF work in this area.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Flick Draft:** Proceed to last call after Mark completes implementation work on C4 and addresses any necessary changes to the specification.
*   **CCNX Content Object Chunking:** Hold an adoption call on the mailing list to adopt the chunking draft as an RG document.
*   **Nameless Objects:** Dave and Mark will collaborate to create a write-up explaining the use cases for Nameless Objects and share it to the list.
*   **Variable Chunk Size in Chunking Draft:** Consider a use case experimentation before adding it to the spec.
*   **Chunking Draft Clarification:** Make it clear in the chunking specification that the right-most chunk ID is the operative field, and trail name segments are possible after that ID.

## Next Steps

*   Mark to continue Flick implementation and testing with C4 and fix ABNF issues in Flick.
*   Address outstanding issues related to reflexive forwarding, particularly the ones highlighted in the slide.
*   Discuss Metaverse interoperability challenges and distributed microservice communication proposal further on the mailing list.
*   Explore the possibility of a hackathon focused on C4 implementation and Metaverse applications.
*   Consider potential contributions for IETF 122 in Bangkok.
