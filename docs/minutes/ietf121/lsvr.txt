## Summary

The LSVR working group meeting covered updates on working group documents, a discussion on the BGP Link-State and NRI selection rules draft, and a presentation on applying SR extensions to BGP-SPF. Key concerns raised included the applicability of certain TLVs and the charter scope for MPLS extensions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **LSVR Base Spec:** Sent to the IS for publication and expected to be picked up by the AD soon.
*   **LSVR Applicability Draft:** Working group last call ended; plan is to send it for publication before the end of the IETF week.
*   **LSVR BGPLS Yang:** Document expired; authors are working on encoding challenges related to variable and unknown TLVs and complex sub-TLV hierarchies. GitHub link available for review and contributions.
*   **LSVR L3DL:** Awaiting working group last call, which is dependent on recharter approval. Review encouraged before the last call.
*   **BGP Link-State and NRI Selection Rules:** A proposal to update NRI selection rules for BGP-SPF to avoid redundant advertisement. Discussion revolved around the potential impact on BGP route selection and the need to consider existing BGP procedures. Suggested to consider RFC 5004 procedures for stable route selection and make the update an optional optimization.
*   **SR Extensions to BGP-SPF:** Presentation of a mechanism to apply SR extensions to BGP-SPF. Questions raised about the applicability of certain TLVs (e.g., line adjacency, SRMS related TLVs) and whether MPLS support fits within the current charter. Suggested to split the draft into two, focusing on IPv6 and MPLS separately. Also suggested to introduce the draft on the mailing list and the SPRING WG.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **LSVR Applicability Draft:** Send to IESG for publication.
*   **BGP Link-State and NRI Selection Rules:** Authors to review RFC 5004 and consider making the proposed update an optional optimization. Address comments and concerns raised during the meeting, and update the document accordingly.
*   **SR Extensions to BGP-SPF:** Authors to consider splitting the draft into IPv6 and MPLS versions. Investigate the applicability of existing TLVs. Introduce the draft on the LSVR mailing list and notify the SPRING WG.
*   **Charter:** Discuss and decide whether to include MPLS and SR extensions to BGP-SPF within the new charter.

## Next Steps

*   AD to pick up the base spec for publication.
*   IESG to approve the recharter.
*   Authors of individual drafts to address feedback and continue development.
*   Working group to discuss the charter scope and potential inclusion of SR extensions.
