<h1>cdni</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This meeting covered several important CDNI topics, including capacity insight, handling third-party dependencies, rechartering considerations, updates on the CI control interface and triggers, named footprints, edge control metadata, new API proposals, and cache management. A key decision was made to move forward with drafts referencing third-party dependencies, following a poll of the working group. Discussion about rechartering the working group to accommodate processing stages and metadata extension language was initiated.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capacity Insight (RFC 9677):</strong> Updates provided on the document's status, currently awaiting IESG telechat review. Encouragement for AD reviewers to examine the document was reiterated.</li>
<li><strong>Third-Party Dependencies (Protected Secrets, Logging):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussion centered on referencing third-party technologies like HashiCorp Vault, AWS S3, and Kafka in IETF drafts.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about normative dependencies on proprietary technologies and version control.</li>
<li>A poll was conducted, and the working group decided to move forward with including third-party dependencies, acknowledging the need for thorough review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rechartering (Processing Stages, Metadata Extension Language):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussion initiated on the need to recharter to include work on processing stages (content mutation/creation) and a metadata extension language (MEL).</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about defining &quot;general purpose&quot; templating languages and accidentally exceeding the group charter.</li>
<li>A decision was made to refine charter language on the mailing list to better define what the group <em>will</em> do, rather than focusing on what it won't.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CI Control Interface and Triggers (draft-ietf-cdni-control-v2):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updates provided on version 15, including the migration towards a more RESTful design.</li>
<li>Discussion of significant changes to the specification of the document, namely unification of CI objects.</li>
<li>Clarification on the handling of purge requests during content acquisition.</li>
<li>A strong plea was made for increased review of the document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Named Footprints (draft-ietf-cdni-named-footprint):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussion of restructuring the draft to separate the data model from the interface.</li>
<li>A new draft will be created to define a restful interface for named footprints. The draft will rely on prior works.</li>
<li>The use of MEL within named footprints was discussed, potentially requiring MEL extensions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Edge Control Metadata (draft-matsumoto-cdni-edge-control-metadata):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Version 3 will be uploaded which refers directly to RFC 806.</li>
<li>Discussion to include a single example for each section in the document to provide clarity. The decision was to maintain the examples after the sections.</li>
<li>Group was asked if it was ready for last call of the document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>HTTP Rest API Proposal:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Proposal for a new draft about HTTP REST APIs in CDNI. This proposal bases on a push model instead of a pull model like the actual one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Extending Request Routing Redirection Interface:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Proposal for a new draft for expanding the capabilities that have been defaulted in 7975 in RFC related to request routing redirection. This interface is about adding redirection features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cache Management Interface:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussed plans for the evolution of the Cash Management Interface work.</li>
<li>Execution policy objectively support the FCA option to support separate management of metadata and content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Move forward with drafts referencing third-party dependencies (Protected Secrets, Logging), with the understanding that thorough review is crucial.
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Ben to continue working on the drafts, incorporating feedback from the mailing list and reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Francesca to ensure the decision regarding third-party dependencies is clearly documented in the shepherd write-up for both drafts.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Participants urged to review the Protected Secrets and Logging drafts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> Refine charter language for rechartering considerations (Processing Stages, Metadata Extension Language) on the mailing list.
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Chris Lemmons to refine the charter language based on meeting feedback and bring it to the mailing list for further discussion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Jay and Alan to incorporate the new requirements for version 16 of the <code>draft-ietf-cdni-control-v2</code> draft.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Alan and Jay must include better explanation the rationate behind this draft.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Alfonso to upload version 3 of <code>draft-matsumoto-cdni-edge-control-metadata</code> which refers directly to RFC 806.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Guillaume, begin creation of the HTTP REST APIs in CDNI draft.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Guillaume, begin creation of the Extending Request Routing Redirection Interface draft.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Alan, be sure to read the HECHBEST cash group working draft.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Participants consider volunteering as document shepherds.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continued discussion on the mailing list regarding charter language refinement.</li>
<li>Focus on reviewing existing drafts, especially Protected Secrets, Logging, and CI Control Interface and Triggers.</li>
<li>Alan will post a recap summary of the recent meetings.</li>
