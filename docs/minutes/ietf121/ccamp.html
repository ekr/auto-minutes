<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 08 Nov 2024 09:30</p>
<h1>ccamp</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The CCAMP working group session covered a range of topics, including updates on existing drafts, presentations of new drafts, and discussions regarding future work items.  Key discussions revolved around the maturity of the optical impairment topology draft, gap analysis for pluggable modeling, and the applicability of AI-based network management agents. The group also discussed the use of Google Sheets for collaborative work and its integration with IETF documents.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optical Impairment Topology Draft Maturity:</strong> Discussed whether the draft is mature enough to move forward despite limitations regarding interoperability and regeneration visibility. The draft will be reviewed by the ITU.</li>
<li><strong>Pluggable Modeling Gap Analysis:</strong> A comprehensive gap analysis is underway, comparing attributes from various standards organizations (IETF, ITU-T, OpenConfig, OIF). The use of a Google Sheet for collaboration was discussed, with concerns raised about accessibility and integration with IETF documents. The goal is to augment or update existing IETF data models based on the analysis.</li>
<li><strong>FGOTN Modeling:</strong>  Presentations covered young data models for Fine-Grained OTN (FGOTN) topology and tunnel, extending existing OTN models. The applicability of GMPLS and PCEP for FGOTN control was also discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Management Streaming:</strong> A young data model for performance management (PM) streaming was presented. The draft may be split into technology-agnostic and technology-specific parts and discussed in OPS and CCAMP respectively.</li>
<li><strong>AI-Based Network Management Agent (NMA):</strong>  A draft introducing an AI-based NMA was presented, seeking input on its architecture and potential applications in transport networks. The group discussed integration models (independent vs. integrated with MCS) and the scope of the NMA (single vs. multi-technology).</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Notifications:</strong> Concerns were raised about the volume of GitHub notifications being sent to the mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optical Impairment Topology Draft:</strong> IPR polling has started. The draft will be presented at an upcoming ITU interim meeting.  Feedback is solicited on its readiness for Working Group Last Call.</li>
<li><strong>Pluggable Modeling:</strong>  The use case document from operators (Oscar's document) and the technical document will be developed as separate documents. The group will explore ways to integrate the information from the Google Sheet into IETF documents.</li>
<li><strong>PM Streaming:</strong>  The PM streaming draft will likely be split into technology-agnostic and technology-specific parts. It may be presented to the OPS working group as well.</li>
<li><strong>FGOTN Modeling:</strong> The group will consider the comments provided and continue work on the FGOTN models.</li>
<li><strong>AI-Based NMA:</strong> Authors to consider feedback and clarify the architecture and scope in future revisions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to address open issues and feedback on presented drafts.</li>
<li>Further collaboration on gap analysis for pluggable modeling.</li>
<li>Schedule weekly meetings for new drafts.</li>
<li>Advertisement of FGOTN weekly meetings in the mailing list.</li>
</ul>
