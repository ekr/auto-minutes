## Summary

This ACE working group meeting at IETF 121 covered updates on several working group documents, including EST-OSCOR, EDHOC-OSCOR profile, Group OSCORE profile, ACE workflow and params, and a draft for adoption on OTHCRED DTLS with additional formats. The discussion focused on technical details, clarifications, and future steps for each document.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **EST-OSCOR:** Discussion around simplifying the protocol by removing DTLS support, clarifying content format identifiers for the SKG endpoint, and referencing RFC-9448 for trust anchor database handling.  Also, clarifying the use of HTTP to avoid confusion.
*   **EDHOC-OSCOR Profile:**  Updates regarding access token upload in EDHOC, disallowing access token uploads to unprotected channels, using EDHOC EID items for session IDs, and dynamic updates of access rights.  Future steps include mandating C-BOR encoding for access token requests and discussions about proof of possession of the client's private key at the AS.
*   **Group OSCORE Profile:** Editorial fixes, clarifications on resource server verification of access rights, guidelines on using multiple profiles, and handling ambiguous client memberships in multiple OSCORE groups. Discussion on storing multiple access tokens per public key. Roadmap for dynamic update of access rights and implications of rekeying.
*   **ACE Workflow and Params:**  Updates on the alternative workflow for access token upload, new parameters (token series ID, 2RS, FROMRS), and use of SHA-256. Discussion on the scope of the token series ID and the extensibility of the 2RS and FROMRS parameters. Potential issues with bidirectional access control and clueless clients were also raised.
*   **OTHCRED DTLS with Additional Formats:**  Enabling alternative formats (CWT claims set, certificates) for authentication credentials in the DTLS profile.  Discussion on hybrid combinations of formats and the use of certificate references.
*   **AISK Groupcom or SCORE:** Update on the publication of ASCII GroupCOM and implementation of changes from IETF last call and IST evaluation in AISK Groupcom or SCORE.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **EST-OSCOR:** Authors to resolve open issues on GitHub and publish version 07 based on current proposals.
*   **ACE Workflow and Params:** Address open issues raised by Christian Bormann, particularly on group audience access tokens, the alternative workflow, and bidirectional access control. Authors to also write down any feedback from Dave Robin in the main list.
*   **OTHCRED DTLS with Additional Formats:**  Consider adding cozy key by reference (RFC 9048) support to the draft.
*   **OTHCRED DTLS with Additional Formats:** Chair to start a two-week adoption call on the list next week.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to continue addressing open issues and incorporate feedback from the working group.
*   Follow up on the adoption call for OTHCRED DTLS with Additional Formats.
*   Future work on the bidirectional access control aspects of the Workflow and Params draft.
