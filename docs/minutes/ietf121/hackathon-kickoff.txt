## Summary

This session was the kickoff for the IETF Hackathon. It covered logistics, goals, code contribution guidelines, project submissions, the schedule, remote participation, presentations, use of Datatracker, related implementation links, the Hack Demo happy hour, the Code Lounge and acknowledgment of sponsors. The session encouraged participation and collaboration.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Welcome and Introductions:** First-time hackathon and IETF attendees were welcomed and encouraged to participate.
*   **Goals of the Hackathon:**
    *   Provide a space for implementing and interoperating on IETF standards.
    *   Attract developers to the IETF.
    *   Engage the next generation of IETF participants.
*   **Note Well and Code Contribution Guidelines:** Participants were reminded of the IETF Note Well and that they retain ownership of their code. Use of open source licenses was strongly encouraged.
*   **Projects:** Over 40 projects were submitted to the wiki. Participants were encouraged to use the wiki's "lost and found" section to find projects or request contributors.
*   **Schedule:** The schedule for both days was reviewed, including lunch, breaks, dinner (day 1), and project presentations (day 2). Emphasis was placed on preparing presentations.
*   **Remote Participation:** Gather Town was mentioned as a means of remote collaboration.
*   **Presentations:** Guidelines for the project presentations were given, emphasizing brevity (3 minutes) and focusing on highlights, contributors, and follow-up steps.
*   **Uploading Presentations:** The process for uploading presentations to Datatracker was explained. GitHub is no longer the method for submitting presentations.
*   **IETF Hackathon GitHub Organization:** The IETF Hackathon GitHub organization remains available for hosting projects.
*   **Related Implementation Links:** The speaker introduced the "related implementation" resource field for linking implementations to drafts in the Datatracker.
*   **Hack Demo Happy Hour:** Participants were invited to the Hack Demo Happy Hour on Monday evening.
*   **Code Lounge:** The Code Lounge was announced as a shared space for collaboration. Reservations can be made on the wiki.
*   **Sponsors:** Acknowledgment was given to sponsors Eric Gold, Meta, and Bronze Sponsor.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Participants to upload presentations to Datatracker before 2:00 PM on day 2.
*   **Decision:** Datatracker is now the sole method for submitting hackathon presentations. GitHub is no longer used for this purpose.

## Next Steps

*   Participants should review the hackathon wiki for project information and collaboration opportunities.
*   Participants should prepare their project presentations for day 2.
*   Participants who wish to participate remotely should use the Gather Town link.
*   Participants should consider attending the Hack Demo Happy Hour on Monday evening.
