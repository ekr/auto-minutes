## Summary
The SCHC working group meeting covered several topics, including the status of various drafts, new proposals for FEC in SCHC, updates on SCHC for CoAP, discussions on applying SCHC to deep space communications, work on networks susceptible to disruptions (formerly zero energy devices), using SCHC and BRUSKI together, and a new concept of SCHC actions.  The main focus of the meeting was on improving the functionality and applicability of SCHC across diverse network environments.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **ICMPV6 Compression Draft:** Laurent Tutan presented the status of the ICMPV6 compression draft.  Discussion included changes to the draft focusing on ICMP compression over constrained devices and the removal of OEM references.
*   **FEC Draft:** Alexander presented a new version of the FEC draft focusing on forward error correction in SCHC, particularly for use cases involving LoRaWAN and smart gas meters. The discussion included two modes of operation (ships in the night and FEC before frag) and considerations for network coding.
*   **SCHC CoAP Draft:** Marco provided an update on the SCHC CoAP draft, focusing on clarifications regarding CoAP option compression, OSCOR, and a proposed new IANA registry for CoAP header fields.
*   **Deep Space Activity:** Mark Blanchet presented a status update on deep space activities, highlighting the challenges of intermittent connectivity and long delays and suggested using SHIC as well as fact over graphs to improve performance.
*   **Disruptible Networks Draft:** Rodrigo Mu√±oz presented work on networks susceptible to disruptions, including considerations for zero energy devices and Leo satellite communications, introducing the concept of a SHIC proxy for local acknowledgements and retransmissions.
*   **SCHC and BRUSKI:** Mariam Hattami presented work combining SCHC and BRUSKI for secure key context management in LoRaWAN IPv6 networks.
*   **SCHC Actions:** Anna presented a new concept of SCHC actions, focusing on derivative rules for flow compression, where rule selection triggers the creation of new rules based on updated header field information. A vote showed support for adding the concept of actions to the architecture.
*   **Protocol Number Draft:** Laurent discussed dropping the UDP port section of the draft and focusing on IP protocol number and EtherType allocation. Eric Vyncke stated that getting early allocation for working group adopted drafts is relatively easy.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **Protocol Number Draft:** The working group agreed to drop the UDP port section from the SHIC protocol number draft.
*   **Architecture Draft:** Authors of the architecture draft to address the state synchronization discussed with the SHIC actions proposal.
*   **Action Item:** Kirsten to follow mailing list regarding state synchronization issues.
*   **Action Item:** All: Look to see if the architecture document is broad enough to support the action item proposal.

## Next Steps
*   Authors of the ICMPv6 draft will change the young data model in the OEM.
*   The FEC draft will include simulation data.
*   Marco will add text to the SCHC CoAP draft to account for the partially Oscar option.
*   The Architecture draft will be updated to account for the addition of actions to rules.
*   Continue discussion of state synchronization methods for derivative rules on the mailing list.
