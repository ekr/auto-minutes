## Summary

This IETF Birds of a Feather (BoF) session explored the potential for chartering a working group focused on IP-based space networking, particularly for lunar and potentially Martian environments. Presentations highlighted use cases, challenges related to long delays and intermittent connectivity, and potential areas of work. A revised charter proposal was discussed, and community feedback was gathered through informal polls regarding scope and interest.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Scope of "Deep Space":** The name "deepspace" is a misnomer. Initial deployments are focused on lunar networking, with potential extensions to Mars. The focus is on IP-based space networks, complementing DTN (Bundle Protocol).
*   **Use Cases:** Presentations highlighted IP-based networks planned for lunar orbiters, habitats, rovers, and Earth-Moon links. Commercial lunar service providers are emerging.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   Long, variable delays (e.g., Earth-Moon: 1.3 seconds one-way; Earth-Mars: 8-45 minutes one-way).
    *   Intermittent connectivity due to orbital dynamics.
    *   Need for interoperability between lunar and terrestrial networks and with DTN-based networks.
    *   Address assignment and management on the lunar surface.
    *   Appropriate transport protocols for long RTTs and disconnections.
    *   Adaptation of application protocols with timeouts and flow control mechanisms.
    *   Time synchronization across networks.
*   **Architecture Considerations:**
    *   Storage and forward mechanisms at Layer 2 or Layer 3 to handle intermittent connectivity.
    *   Buffer management and provisioning.
    *   Considerations for IPV6 and different transports apart from TCP.
    *   Potential use of transport proxies (e.g., QUIC proxies) and MASQUE.
    *   Avoiding DNS resolution over deep space links through pre-fetching and caching.
*   **Charter Discussion:**
    *   Debate on whether to include Mars in the initial scope.
    *   Clarification of "end-to-end" in the context of space networks.
    *   Whether it should be focus on low complexity communications.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Chairs to revise the charter proposal based on community feedback. Revisions will consider:
    *   Refining the description of the scope to accurately represent space agencies' plans.
    *   Clarifying whether the working group will evaluate and contrast rather than write the IP architecture, with consideration of an adaption.
    *   Clarifying that the work focuses on scenarios with potential direct point to point communication possibility.
    *   Specifying whether existing protocols will be profiled, or extended.
    *   Refining the description of the scope to more accurately represent space agencies plans.
    *   Adding Security to the area of work.
    *   Referencing security framework other than TLS as options.
    *   Review whether working group should focus on quick or additional protocols.
*   **Decision:** To take charter refinement efforts to the mailing list for further discussion and finalization.

## Next Steps

*   Chairs will circulate a revised charter proposal on the mailing list.
*   Community to provide feedback on the revised charter.
*   The Area Director (AD) and IESG will assess community support for the charter and determine whether to charter a working group.
