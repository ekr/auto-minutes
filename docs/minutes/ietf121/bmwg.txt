## Summary
The Benchmarking Working Group (BMWG) session at IETF 121 in Dublin covered a variety of topics, including updates on existing drafts, new proposals, and discussions on benchmarking methodologies for network performance in different environments. Presentations ranged from multiple loss ratio search algorithms to young data models for network tester management, SRv6 service benchmarking, source address validation, time calibration between network elements, and power consumption in network devices. The session highlighted the importance of contributing to and reviewing working group drafts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Multiple Loss Ratio Search (MLR Search):** Discussion on the latest draft update (version 08), including changes in the specification and further explanations. The draft is considered ready for working group last call. Examples were provided to illustrate the logic.
*   **YANG Data Model for Network Tester Management:** Presentation on module changes and hackathon results, focusing on the validation of sequence error reporting functionality. The draft is considered stable, with a call for more users and reviewers.
*   **Benchmarking Network Performance in Container Infrastructures:** Updates to the draft, addressing comments from the RFC 8204 authors and modifying figures to better represent container networking models. The document is potentially ready for last call.
*   **Benchmark Methodology for Segment Routing:** Update on the progress and status of the document, addressing fragmentation issues and compressed seats for SRv6. A cross-post with the Spring and SRB Ops working groups is in progress.
*   **Recommendation for Using Multiple IP Addresses in Benchmarking Tests:** Results of tests on the number of IP addresses that should be used to resolve RSS problems.
*   **SRv6 Service Benchmarking:** Update on the progress of the work. There are also some content related to our existing segment routing benchmarking document, so may be can contribute to the existing document of course you can talk with.
*   **Benchmarking Methodologies for Source Address Validation:** Presentation on updates to the draft based on feedback from the IETF 120 meeting, including clarifying traffic directions and protocol convergence time measurement. A benchmarking tool is being developed based on SOP.
*   **Calibration of Measured Time Values Between Network Elements:** Discussion on a new proposal for calibrating time values in hop-by-hop delay measurements, highlighting issues such as variations in line cards and the need for a baseline measurement using a tester.
*   **Benchmarking Methodology for Power in Network Devices:** Introduction to the benchmarking and modelling of power usage in networking devices, revealing variations across power supplies and software versions.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **MLR Search:** The working group will initiate a last call for the draft.
*   **YANG Data Model:** Aim to attract more users and reviewers to test the model.
*   **Segment Routing:** The working group will wait for comments from the Spring and SRB Ops working groups.
*   **Source Address Validation:** Develop a benchmarking tool and share a presentation to the Hexone in the next IETF.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for topics such as SRv6 service benchmarking, power consumption, and time calibration.
*   Address feedback and open points identified for new proposals.
*   Encourage review and contribution to working group drafts.
