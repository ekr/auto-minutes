## Summary

This meeting covered updates on adopted working group items (multipath and Q-log), potential new work (QUIC address discovery), and a presentation on flexicast QUIC. Key discussions focused on the readiness of the multipath draft for working group last call, the JSON-Sec serialization format for Q-log, and the value of adding address discovery functionality to QUIC.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Reliable Reset and Act Frequency:** Discussion around implementation status, interoperability testing, and deployment considerations for both. WebTransport and MOQ's dependencies on reliable reset were highlighted.
*   **Multipath Draft:**
    *   Semantic and mechanical updates from draft-10 to draft-11.
    *   Hekkestone report for draft-11 showed progress with multiple implementations.
    *   Discussions on open issues: CID exhaustion, error codes for path abandonment, PTO handling, and path migration vs. new path creation.
    *   Lars Eggert raised concerns about the draft's scope, distinguishing between establishing/maintaining paths versus providing comprehensive multipath guidance.
    *   Need for editorial pass to clarify normative vs. informative sections and potentially restructure the document.
*   **Q-log:**
    *   Updates on timestamp handling and schema simplification.
    *   Discussion on adding a field to stream/datagram data moved events to signal blocking reasons (congestion control, flow control).
    *   Bike shed discussion around JSON-Sec format: pros, cons, alternatives, and potential migration paths.
*   **QUIC Address Discovery:**
    *   Marten Seemann presented a draft for address discovery, intended for P2P use cases including NAT traversal.
    *   Discussion on whether the working group should adopt this draft, with concerns raised about having a solution without a clear problem/use case.
*   **Flexicast QUIC:**
    *   Luis presented a draft for flexible multicast inside QUIC, leveraging multipath QUIC.
    *   Highlighted unicast and flexicast path usage with unicast acknowledgments.
    *   Implementation results showing potential scalability improvements.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Reliable Reset:** Follow up on scheduling virtual interop testing, possibly waiting for the Bangkok hackathon.
*   **Multipath Draft:**
    *   Editors team to coordinate on editorial pass and address open issues.
    *   Authors to provide a proposal for restructuring the document.
    *   Encourage those who haven't read a recent draft to do so and collaborate.
    *   Chairs to have a chat with the editors team.
    *   Consider an interim meeting.
*   **Q-log:**
    *   Editors team to address remaining minor issues and aim for working group last call by the end of the year.
    *   Address the issue with the JSON-Sec format and choose one and only one format.
    *   Clarify how to use JSON-Sec format for different audiences (human vs. machine).
*   **QUIC Address Discovery:**
    *   Defer any decisions about adoption to future meetings.
    *   Authors to provide use case on the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Multipath Draft: Address editorial feedback, propose document restructuring, and plan potentially interim meeting.
*   Q-log: Resolve format selection and prepare for working group last call.
*   QUIC Address Discovery: Authors to present use cases on the mailing list and the quick mailing list for consideration.
*   Deep Space Buff will be held after lunch tomorrow.
