## Summary

This meeting of the CBO Working Group focused on updates to existing drafts, discussions on EDN literals, CDE, CDDL modules, and an overview of applications in DNS. Key discussion points included the design and implementation of EDN literals, the scope and application of CDE rules, and the use of CBOR in DNS messages with name compression.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **EDN Literals:** Discussion revolved around the ABNF for single-quoted strings within EDN literals, specifically how extensions should define the content within those strings. There was debate about whether extensions should be able to define their own ABNF for the content, and the implications for parsing and escaping.
*   **CDE (Common Deterministic Encoding):**  Lawrence presented a view that the use cases for CDE are relatively small.  He argued that Application Level Deterministic Representation (ALDR) rules (formerly profiles) should either be eliminated or broadened to apply to all CBOR serialization options, not just CDE.  Karsten argued for keeping the ALDR rules, pointing out their relevance in scenarios like CTAP2 and CDDL schemes.
*   **DNS CBOR:** Martina presented her work on using CBOR for DNS messages, focusing on name compression and structured data types. She raised questions about the appropriate tag size for referencing names in the compressed format, and the use of resource record sets versus individual resource records. She also inquired where this work should be adopted (CBO WG vs DNSOP WG).

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **CDDL Modules:**  The CDDL modules item was removed from the agenda for this meeting. It will be discussed in a future interim meeting.
*   **EDN Literals:** Karsten proposed to stick with the untweaked common syntax for string literals and ship the existing ABNF with the EDN specification. He will provide a tool to translate the base ABNF combined with any number of ABN snippets given into ABNF for a single level ABNF.
    *   **Action Item:** Karsten to share EDN Literal draft and allow comments.
*   **CDE:** Lawrence, Anders, and Karsten to continue the discussion offline regarding the scope and application of ALDR rules in CDE.
*   **DNS CBOR:**
    *   **Action Item:** Martina to discuss with DNSOP chairs regarding potential adoption in DNSOP.
    *   **Action Item:** Martina to circulate updated version of the draft.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list and in side meetings during the week.
*   Address feedback on the EDN literals draft.
*   Reach a consensus on the scope and application of CDE rules.
*   Determine the appropriate venue for the DNS CBOR work (CBO WG or DNSOP WG).
