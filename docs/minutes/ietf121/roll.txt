## Summary

The roll working group meeting covered the status of several drafts, including enrollment priority, nstance extension, and MOPEX. A minor rechartering effort was proposed to align the charter with the current working group drafts. John provided feedback on the rechartering proposal. There was a discussion about Dow projection, with Pascal expressing the importance of its completion for presentation to groups like Waysson. The meeting also touched on the potential for a Ripple version 2 and the need for consumer demand before undertaking such a significant effort.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Rechartering:** A minor rechartering effort was proposed to align the charter with current drafts. The proposed changes involve deleting completed work items, adding new ones related to network resilience and secure network enrollment, and modifying the description of protocol elements for optimization.
*   **Enrollment Priority:** Open issues are considered minor. After addressing them, a last call will be initiated.
*   **nstance Extension:** Aris is working on modifying the draft to be an orthogonal independent feature applicable to any objective function, rather than being tied to MRHOF. The changes are being made minimally to ease review.
*   **MOPEX:** Dominique is reportedly working on addressing the two main open issues.
*   **Dow Projection:** Pascal emphasized the importance of Dow projection for smart grid automation and its presentation to Waysson. John is prioritizing it in his queue but has other documents ahead of it.
*   **Ripple V2:** Pascal raised the topic of Ripple V2, but the need for consumers before undertaking a rewrite of the spec to create V2 was raised and supported.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Rechartering:** The working group agreed to proceed with a minor rechartering effort based on the presented proposal. The chairs will move this forward.
*   **Enrollment Priority:** Authors to address the minor open issues. After this is completed the draft should be moved to last call.
*   **nstance Extension:** Aris to continue working on the modifications and provide an updated draft in a few weeks. Pascal agreed to review the updates to the draft.
*   **MOPEX:** Encourage Dominique to provide updates on progress.
*   **Dow Projection:** John will try to prioritize it in his queue and consider putting it ahead of RNFD.

## Next Steps

*   The roll chairs will start the rechartering process.
*   Authors of enrollment priority will address the open issues.
*   Aris will continue work on the nstance extension.
*   Monitor progress on MOPEX and Dow Projection.
