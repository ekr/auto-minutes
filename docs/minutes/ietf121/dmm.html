<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 05 Nov 2024 09:30</p>
<h1>dmm</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The DMM working group meeting covered several topics, including mobility over transport network slicing for 5G, an in-loop proposal, map architecture for mobile networks, mobile traffic steering, computing-aware traffic steering, SRV6 reduction for SRVASIC, and an introduction to 6G research. Discussions focused on technical details, addressing previous concerns, and aligning with other working groups and standards.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobility over Transport Network Slicing for 5G:</strong> The draft has been updated to use ACAS (Attachment Circuit as a Service) instead of EP transport, resulting in changes to the Yang models. Reviews from T's and ops have been incorporated. Concerns regarding the mapping like from NSAI were raised and will be checked and validated.</li>
<li><strong>In-Loop Proposal:</strong> The draft aims to address 6G requirements by integrating transport functionalities for access and core networks. Major concerns were raised regarding the inconsistencies between current architectures and those proposed in this document and the impact that it would have on the UPF and the AMF and SMF functionality. Concerns were raised on how this document might deliver or be useful to ongoing 6G development.</li>
<li><strong>Map Architecture for Mobile Networks:</strong> A map architecture draft to support end-to-end network slicing and optimal data paths was discussed. A BGP extensions draft in the BEST working group depends on the adoption of this document. Discussion about if this draft should progress in standard or information track.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Traffic Steering:</strong> The use cases, scenarios, and architectural options for mobile traffic steering were discussed, including decoupling a mobile node's IP address from a topologically matching user plane anchor.</li>
<li><strong>Computing-Aware Traffic Steering:</strong> The enhancement of the map architecture with a computing-aware traffic steering concept was presented.</li>
<li><strong>SRV6 Reduction for SRVASIC:</strong> An update was provided on a draft to reduce SRV6 header overhead by compressing two SIDs into a single SID. Implementation testing is ongoing.</li>
<li><strong>Introduction to 6G Research:</strong> The &quot;6G Reset&quot; initiative was introduced, focusing on user-centric connectivity, economic viability, and sustainability. IETF DMM individual participation was encouraged.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobility over Transport Network Slicing for 5G:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Alain volunteered to review the draft within two weeks.</li>
<li>Authors will inform 3GPP of the updates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>In-Loop Proposal:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Authors will address the concerns regarding architectural assumptions and potential impact on the current mobility protocol standards and architectures (specifically regarding interfaces, UPF and other related functions), and will work to provide a better justification of what is needed by ANUP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Map Architecture for Mobile Networks:</strong>
<ul>
<li>More reviews are needed. Vianna volunteered to review.</li>
<li>Decision on progressing in informational or standard track deferred pending feedback on the document's technical approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Traffic Steering:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Feedback to be posted on the mailing list. Option call will be done if there are no further comments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SRV6 Reduction for SRVASIC:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Author should allocate a SR endpoint behavior code as soon as possible to avoid conflicts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors to address feedback and revise drafts accordingly.</li>
<li>Reviewers to provide feedback on the mailing lists.</li>
<li>Working group chairs to initiate adoption calls as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
