## Summary

The ASDF working group meeting at IETF 121 covered the working group status, a discussion on non-affordance information related to digital twins, an update on the Nipsey draft including a hackathon report, and future meeting plans. Key discussions revolved around how to represent non-affordance information within SDF, integrating Nipsey with SDF and SCIM, and potential future directions for Nipsey, including alternative transport protocols.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Digital Twins and Non-Affordance Information:**
    *   Michael Koster presented on the need for a top-down view of adding digital twin support to SDF, focusing on non-affordance information and instance graphs.
    *   Kirsten emphasized the importance of the "instance" part of the instance graph, representing single things with attributes like serial numbers and locations, distinct from class information.
    *   Debate on whether non-affordance information should be a new block type or a specialized property type within SDF.
    *   Ari suggested an informative document explaining how to use SDF to describe digital twins, and a normative document explaining how to include non-affordance information in SDF.
*   **Nipsey and SDF Integration:**
    *   Bart Brinkman presented the ASDF hackathon report, focusing on integrating SDF with Nipsey and SCIM.
    *   The hackathon team explored mapping Nipsey properties and events to SDF properties and events, proposing a new Nipsey quality for SDF properties and events.
    *   Discussion on obfuscating property names for confidentiality when sending a subset of the SDF model to a Nipsey gateway.
    *   The team also worked on mapping an SDF model to a version of a thing, proposing a manifest to include in SCIM or MUD files.
    *   Elliot provided an example of a typical flow to get things going for CoAP over Nipsey slash BLE.
    *   Discussion on whether to move Nipsey from HTTP to MQTT.
*   **Nipsey Draft Update:**
    *   Bart Brinkman presented changes in draft 3, including API changes to align with ASDF principles, consolidating property types, and updating the schema.
    *   Open questions for the working group include whether to specify the SDF Nipsey quality in the Nipsey draft or a separate document, and whether to continue to use RESTful interfaces or shift to MQTT.
*   **Meeting Plans:**
    *   Discussion on planning additional Nipsey design meetings and an ASDF interim in early next year.
    *   The possibility of meeting at IETF in Bangkok was discussed, but the decision was deferred to a later date, contingent on attendance interest.
    *   A design team meeting on digital twin architecture was discussed.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Post a call to the list to gauge interest in attending IETF Bangkok to inform the decision about meeting there.
*   **Action Item:** Schedule a design team meeting on digital twin architecture for early January, to be folded into the interim if appropriate.
*   **Decision:** Continue with the current Nipsi draft, focusing on technical work over name changes.
*   **Action Item:** Elliott to come back with more detailed slides with other options and details for integrating with existing use cases and potential future paths.

## Next Steps

*   Post on the mailing list regarding IETF Bangkok.
*   Schedule Nipsey design meetings.
*   Schedule ASDF Interim in mid-late January.
*   Review and comment on the Nipsey draft.
*   Prepare material for a design team meeting about digital twin architecture at the interim meeting.
