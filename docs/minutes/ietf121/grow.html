<h1>grow</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The grow working group meeting at IETF 121 covered several topics related to global routing operations. Discussions included BMP over QUIC, BMP statistics, the use of the DSCP field, a Peering API proposal, offline BMP, and BGP operational security considerations. Several calls for working group adoption were made for presented drafts.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>BMP over QUIC:</strong> A presentation on using BMP over QUIC highlighted potential benefits like improved efficiency and security. Concerns were raised regarding the necessity of security enhancements, potential race conditions with message handling, and the relevance of head-of-line blocking for BMP implementations. There was some agreement that a separate control channel might be beneficial.</li>
<li><strong>BMP Statistics:</strong> An update on the application for IANA code points for new statistical types in the BMP protocol was presented. The importance of an implementation status section for draft progression was emphasized.</li>
<li><strong>Use of DSCP Field:</strong> A presentation discussed the practical use of the DSCP field and its divergence from RFC specifications. The need for standardization and operational considerations was debated. There wasn't really a consensus on what the group could do to contribute to addressing this gap.</li>
<li><strong>Peering API:</strong> A proposal for a Peering API to automate peering turn-up was presented. The discussion centered on the need for such an API, especially with the increasing adoption of RPKI, and whether a standardized LOA substitute could be beneficial. The usefulness of signing the object or not was discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Offline BMP:</strong> A new draft proposing TLVs to make BMP usable offline was introduced. The draft suggested sending periodic summaries of all peers to reduce the amount of data needed to parse to determine peer status. It was proposed that the message generation is a property of the BMP station, but it could also be a property of the BMP exporter. There were questions regarding how errors and conflicts are handled.</li>
<li><strong>BGP Operational Security Considerations:</strong> An update on BGP operational security considerations was given. The approach of splitting the core policy document from implementation examples into separate &quot;eternal drafts&quot; was discussed. There were some concerns about this and the verbage in the documents and if policymakers interpret it to strictly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>BMP over QUIC:</strong> The presenter was encouraged to address concerns on the mailing list and consider a separate control channel.</li>
<li><strong>BMP Statistics:</strong> The presenter was requested to include an implementation status section in the next version of the draft (version 06).</li>
<li><strong>Peering API:</strong> A new call for working group adoption will be initiated for the current version of the document (version 6).</li>
<li><strong>BGP Operational Security Considerations:</strong> A call for adoption should be done for the document. Discuss the wording on the mailing list for consideration in editing the draft.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mailing list discussions will continue for BMP over QUIC, the use of the DSCP field, and the BGP operational security draft.</li>
<li>Updated drafts will be submitted for BMP Statistics, Peering API, Offline BMP, and BGP Operational Security Consideration.</li>
<li>Working group adoption calls will be initiated for the Peering API proposal and the BGP Operational Security Consideration drafts.</li>
</ul>
