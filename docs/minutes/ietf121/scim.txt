## Summary
The SCIM working group meeting covered several key topics, including the adoption of the SCIM use cases draft, updates on the device model draft, and progress on cursor pagination and SCIM events. The discussion focused on clarifying the scope and purpose of the use cases document, addressing security concerns and optional telemetry endpoints in the device model, and confirming the readiness of cursor pagination and SCIM events drafts for shepherd write-up.

## Key Discussion Points
*   **SCIM Use Cases Draft:**
    *   The draft aims to provide implementers with a broader understanding of how SCIM can be applied, beyond individual SCIM connections.
    *   The draft defines orchestrator roles (resource creator, subscriber, manager) to describe data movement between domains.
    *   The discussion highlighted the difference between single-tenant and multi-tenant considerations.
    *   The use cases draft includes scenarios related to device provisioning and management.
    *   The group agreed to adopt the draft as an informational architecture document with example use cases.
*   **SCIM Device Model Draft:**
    *   The draft defines a slim core device model with extensions for describing device connectivity and attributes.
    *   Two main issues were discussed:
        *   Validation of DNS names in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) when used for client endpoint identification.
        *   Handling optional telemetry endpoints for BLE and Zigbee devices.
*   **Cursor Pagination:**
    *   Confirmed interoperability between client and server implementations.
    *   The authors have addressed all comments.
    *   The draft is ready for shepherd write-up.
*   **SCIM Events:**
    *   Working Group Last Call completed.
    *   Shepherd write-up is the next step.
    *   Multiple implementations are expected, including participation in the Gartner interrupt in December.

## Decisions and Action Items
*   **SCIM Use Cases Draft:**
    *   **Decision:** Adopt the draft as an informational architecture document with example use cases.
    *   **Action Item:** Chairs to issue a working group adoption call, soliciting feedback beyond a simple yes/no.
    *   **Action Item:** Authors to consider including a description of enterprise use of SCIM, focusing on the relevance of SCIM.
*   **SCIM Device Model Draft:**
    *   **Action Item:** Elliot to address the two outstanding issues and produce a new draft.
        *   Seek guidance on whether to validate DNS names against reverse IP lookups when using SANs for client endpoint identification.
        *   Clarify how optional telemetry endpoints are handled and signal the absence of telemetry support to clients.
*   **Cursor Pagination:**
    *   **Action Item:** Anjali to complete the shepherd write-up.
*   **SCIM Events:**
    *   **Action Item:** Shepherd to write up.

## Next Steps
*   Chairs to issue a working group adoption call for the SCIM Use Cases draft.
*   Elliot to update the SCIM Device Model draft based on the discussion.
*   Anjali to complete the shepherd write-up for the cursor pagination draft.
*   Shepherd to write up the SCIM Events draft.
