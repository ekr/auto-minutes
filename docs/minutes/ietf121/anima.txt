## Summary

The anima working group met to discuss updates on several drafts including JWS voucher, Bruskey with pledge in responder mode, constrained Bruskey, and Bruskey Discovery.  New work proposals included Lightweight Grasp. Discussion centered on technical details, implementation considerations, and next steps for each document.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **JWS Voucher:** Awaiting TILA chat after expert review. An update needs to be posted after the current window to trigger the IESG Telechat.
*   **Bruskey with Pledge in Responder Mode:** Currently in AD review.  Further interop testing encouraged.
*   **Constrained Bruskey:** Update on implementation in a simulated environment. Discussions about the CA certificate request/response, multi-part core, and cozy voucher media type.
*   **Bruskey Discovery:** Improvements to text and inclusion of detailed requirements for proxies and Brulski pledge enhancements. Focus on vendor documentation requirements and considerations for redundant discovery.
*   **Lightweight Grasp:** Proposed lighter version of Grasp based on UDP intended for IoT networks. There was discussion on it's necessity given the availability of CoAP.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **JWS Voucher:** Thomas to post an update after the current submission window to trigger the IESG Telechat.
*   **Bruskey Discovery:** Bruce to incorporate feedback and consider Core LF integration.
*   **Lightweight Grasp:** Authors to make a comparison between their UDP-based mechanism and using a CoAP encapsulation of Grasp.
*   **Grass Distribution:** Chairs to communicate that the document is dead, as it doesn't show up on the Working Group Datatracker page. Authors to submit a revised version after the meeting to confirm its scope and interest within the working group.

## Next Steps

*   Schedule an interim meeting to further discuss the upcoming work items.
*   Engage on the mailing list regarding future topics.
*   Follow up with potential adopters of the new work proposals.
