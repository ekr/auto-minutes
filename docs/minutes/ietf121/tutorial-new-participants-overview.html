<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 03 Nov 2024 12:30</p>
<h1>Tutorial: New Participants' Overview</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This session provided an overview of the IETF, its structure, processes, and how new participants can get involved. Key topics included the IETF's mission, funding, organizational structure (IESG, IRTF, IAB, IANA, RFC Editor), consensus-based decision-making, and resources available for newcomers. Practical advice was given on joining working groups, contributing to existing work, and proposing new work. The session also covered what to expect at an IETF meeting, including working group sessions, Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions, IRTF sessions, plenary, hackathon, and social events. Finally, the session concluded with an overview of the resources available to new IETF participants.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>IETF Mission and Principles:</strong> The IETF's mission is to make the Internet work better by producing quality standards. Participation is open to all individuals, contributions are judged on technical merit, and decisions are made by rough consensus, not votes.</li>
<li><strong>IETF Structure:</strong> The IETF is structured around areas managed by Area Directors within the IESG. The IRTF focuses on research, while the IAB handles external liaisons and architectural issues. IANA manages protocol parameter assignments (port numbers, etc.), and the RFC Editor publishes documents.</li>
<li><strong>Consensus Building:</strong> Consensus is reached when all issues have been addressed and dissenting opinions have been heard, but don't block progress. Various methods are used to measure consensus, including Meetecho polls and mailing list discussions, and the chair assesses and documents the consensus.</li>
<li><strong>Joining and Contributing to Working Groups:</strong> The Datatracker is the key tool for accessing information about working groups, documents, and mailing list archives. Newcomers should review documents beforehand to understand the ongoing work.</li>
<li><strong>Starting New Work:</strong> New work should address a well-defined problem within the IETF's scope and align with its architectural principles. Socializing the idea and finding collaborators are crucial for success. The IAB's new work help desk and Hot RFC sessions can facilitate this.</li>
<li><strong>IETF Meeting Experience:</strong> Meetings include working group sessions, BoFs, IRTF sessions, and a plenary. Working group sessions focus on solving key issues. The hackathon encourages prototyping of specifications.</li>
<li><strong>New Participant Resources:</strong> Various events are organized for new participants, including a tutorial, a Meetecho test session, quick connections, a dinner, and a social hour. The secretariat is available to answer questions. The IAB will have a new work help desk available.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Secretariat to determine if space can be added for the new participant dinner on Monday.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Secretariat to post meetup spot for new participants for lunch.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>New participants are encouraged to attend the Meetecho test session immediately following this tutorial.</li>
<li>New participants are encouraged to attend Quick Connections to meet other participants and leadership.</li>
<li>All attendees should review the slides online and contact the secretariat with any questions.</li>
<li>New participants should check the mailing list for location of new participant meetup spot.</li>
</ul>
