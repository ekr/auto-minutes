## Summary

The meeting covered updates to the requirements document, a discussion on delegation models, a comparison of two proposed solutions (Deleg and \_delic), and initial steps for moving forward with protocol development. A show of hands was conducted to gauge the room's preference on the two proposed solutions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Requirements Document:** Last call on the requirements document is imminent. The document will remain a living document. A working group last call will be started shortly after this meeting, possibly extended due to the US Thanksgiving holiday.
*   **Delegation Models (Paul):** Three delegation models were presented: direct, indirect, and mixed. The importance of choosing one model early in protocol design was emphasized to avoid a messy protocol.
    *   Discussion ensued regarding parent vs. child authority and the role of resolvers.
*   **Omnibus vs. Discrete RR Types (Paul):** An overview of using omnibus RR types (like SVCB) versus discrete RR types was presented. Considerations included parsing complexity, extensibility, and feature interactions. Developers' perspectives were solicited.
    *   Discussion included the difficulty of matching discrete records and the extensibility of SVCB.
*   **Solution Comparison (Philip & Petter):** A detailed comparison of two proposed solutions, Deleg (new RR type) and \_delic (using SVCB in a new name space), was presented. Trade-offs regarding deployment complexity, resolver complexity, query counts, and upgrade paths were discussed.
    *   Concerns were raised regarding the difficulty and potential risks of activating either proposal in operational networks.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Start working group last call for the requirements document. (Chairs)
*   **Decision:** Conduct show of hands on solution preferences.
*   **Action Item:** Set up a GitHub testing page for both Deleg and \_delic.
*   **Decision:** Encourage continued discussions on the mailing list in parallel with the requirements document's working group last call.

## Next Steps

*   Start working group last call for the requirements document.
*   Continue discussions of Deleg and \_delic solutions on the mailing list.
*   Potentially create a common draft with a set of differences that was suggested to help the working group decide not just which direction do we want to go, but why we want to go in a particular direction.
*   Developers to begin implementation and testing of both Deleg and \_delic.
