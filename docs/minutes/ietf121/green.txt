## Summary

The first meeting of the newly created IETF green working group covered a packed agenda including presentations and discussions on requirements, terminology, metrics, and modeling proposals related to energy efficiency in networks. The focus was on defining use cases, establishing a common terminology, and identifying key metrics for energy consumption in networking. There was consensus to adopt the first terminology draft presented as a starting point.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Requirements and Use Cases:** Emphasis was placed on defining use cases first, before solidifying specific requirements. Use cases will drive the direction and prioritization of work within the working group. There was discussion about which use cases were appropriate.
*   **Terminology:** Two drafts on terminology were presented. The consensus was that the first draft, "draft-bclp-green-terminology," should be the starting point for a working group document.
*   **Metrics:** Several drafts on energy metrics were presented, covering power consumption per data rate, PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness), network equipment energy efficiency, and energy proportion coefficient. Consideration was given to how these metrics could be aggregated and standardized. The importance of aligning with other standards organizations (e.g., ETSI, 3GPP) was discussed.
*   **Modeling:** Yang data models for power management were presented. The need for simple models and for parallel progress on requirements and models was noted.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Adopt Terminology Draft:** The working group agreed to adopt "draft-bclp-green-terminology" as the starting point for the working group's terminology document. Input from the second terminology draft will be incorporated.
*   **Virtual Interim Meetings:** There is sufficient interest to hold virtual interim meetings to further discuss and refine specific areas, including use cases, terminology, and metrics.
*   **Requirements work:** The use case document requires further development and discussion on the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   The chairs will schedule virtual interim meetings.
*   Discussions will continue on the mailing list to refine use cases, requirements, terminology, and metrics.
*   Contribute to improve all the drafts.
