## Summary

The lake session at IETF 120 in Dublin covered several topics related to lightweight authorization and key establishment (LAKE) for constrained environments. The meeting included updates on existing working group items (LAKE-ODS, Implementation Considerations), as well as presentations on individual submissions covering remote attestation, pre-shared key authentication, application profiles, and trust anchor hints. The discussion focused on technical details, implementation aspects, and future directions for the working group.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **LAKE-ODS (Ella - Ad Hoc with Lightweight Authorization):** Updates included the naming of the protocol (Ella), new appendix for ad hoc reverse flow, and optimization strategies for device onboarding. Focus shifted towards separating core authorization aspects from enrollment use cases. Performance evaluations compared Ella with IP ad hoc on duty-cycled networks, showing advantages in handshake duration.
*   **Implementation Considerations:** Updates focused on aligning with ACE profile using ad hoc, clarifying resource server behavior, trust models (learning policies), and handling ad hoc over CoAP and blockwise transfers. The need for guidelines on message processing was discussed, as well as concrete examples of credentials.
*   **Remote Attestation over Ad Hoc:** The draft was restructured, defining three dimensions for remote attestation: target (IoT device or network service), model (background check or passport), and message flow (ad hoc forward or reverse). New EAD items were introduced to trigger attestation. Implementation and measurements were presented for IoT device attestation in the background check model.
*   **Greece for Ad Hoc:** The presentation advocated for using random extensions to ensure future extensibility of the protocol. Recommendations included registering a few unused EAD items and cipher suites, and randomly sprinkling them over connections.
*   **Pre-Shared Key Authentication with Ad Hoc:** The presentation focused on the PSK2 variant and mutual authentication. Metrics and evaluations were performed using Cryptocell 310. Flash memory consumption was slightly higher for PSK2 due to additional code.
*   **Application Profiles for Ad Hoc:** The draft proposed a method for defining, distributing, and using ad hoc application profiles to standardize parameter negotiation. The discussion included the identification of application profiles using integer identifiers, parameters describing application aspects, and a Cibor-based canonical representation.
*   **Trust Anchor Hints:** The co-author stated that the draft has been made obsolete by the application profile draft as it covered credential types.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Chairs to ask Marek to present his ad hoc interoperability test service at the next meeting.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs to schedule a virtual interim meeting in January after the holiday period.
*   **Decision:** Prioritize call for adoption for drafts in the following order: Greece, Application Profiles, PSK Authentication, Remote Attestation.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs to initiate a call for adoption for the Greece draft next week for two weeks.
*   **Action Item:** Assess input from participants as to whether drafts should be moved to the next stage quickly.

## Next Steps

*   Initiate calls for adoption for the prioritized drafts in the specified order, starting with the Greece draft.
*   Schedule a virtual interim meeting for January to discuss working group items and adoption of new drafts.
*   Address feedback and comments received during the meeting and incorporate them into the respective drafts.
