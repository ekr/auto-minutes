## Summary
This meeting focused on the status update of the WHEP draft, the recharter discussion, and the potential next steps for the working group. A key point of discussion was whether a requirements draft was necessary for the WHEP draft to move forward. The chairs will prioritize getting the recharter process moving.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **WHEP Draft Status:** Version 9 of the WHEP draft has been pushed out, and an IETF last call has been requested. Julia's comments will be treated as IETF last call comments. The goal is to push the draft to the ISG by September.
*   **Recharter Discussion:** The working group is at an impasse regarding the WHEP draft. While a revised charter has been proposed, one individual believes a requirements draft is necessary.
*   **Requirements Draft Debate:**
    *   Some participants believe that publishing the WHEP draft will help the Internet work better and that waiting for a requirements draft is unnecessary.
    *   Others suggest a requirements draft could help limit the scope of the WHEP draft and prevent the working group from getting bogged down with too many features.
    *   Concerns were raised about the lack of volunteers to write such a draft.
*   **Moving Forward:** The general sentiment was to proceed with the recharter and be mindful of limiting the scope of the initial WHEP draft.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Decision:** Proceed with the recharter process without mandating a requirements draft.
*   **Action Item:** Chairs to send out a message to kickstart the recharter process and address any remaining concerns.

## Next Steps

*   Continue the IETF last call process for the WHEP draft.
*   Chairs to focus on getting the recharter process moving forward, as it was delayed previously.
