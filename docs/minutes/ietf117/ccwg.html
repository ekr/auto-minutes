<h1>CCWG Meeting Minutes</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The first meeting of the Congestion Control Working Group (CCWG) covered a variety of topics including a recap of the working group charter, discussions surrounding the revision of RFC5033 (&quot;5033bis&quot;), an analysis of differences between standard congestion control schemes, an update on BBRv3 deployment at Google, congestion control for DCCP, and a new approach to congestion control using inbound telemetry. The meeting involved active participation from attendees, with a focus on defining the scope of the working group's activities and prioritizing future work.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Charter Review:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The CCWG charter focuses on congestion control, applicable to all transport protocols, not just TCP.</li>
<li>The working group is looking for proposals with empirical evidence of safety and stated intent to deploy.</li>
<li>Coordination with other working groups (e.g., ICCRG, TCPM) is a priority.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>RFC5033bis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussion on whether to adopt the existing 5033bis draft as the starting point or start from scratch.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about recommendations in RFC5843 having negative effects.</li>
<li>Authorship of the document was discussed, with a proposal to remove Sally Floyd and Mark Allman as authors.</li>
<li>The scope of 5033bis was debated, specifically whether to address multipath congestion control.</li>
<li>A discussion about the definition of &quot;fairness&quot; within the context of congestion control, with suggestions to focus on &quot;freedom from starvation&quot; instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Analysis of Congestion Control Schemes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A presentation comparing various congestion control standards, including TCP Reno, QUIC Reno, and Cubic.</li>
<li>Differences in initial window sizes, minimum RTO, and loss window were highlighted.</li>
<li>It was suggested that 5681 should be updated to align with 9002.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>BCP41 Update:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussion about updating or replacing BCP41 (principles of congestion control).</li>
<li>A key proposal was to differentiate between congestion and persistent congestion.</li>
<li>A suggestion was made to replace the term &quot;congestion control&quot; with &quot;rate optimizer.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>BBRv3 Update:</strong>
<ul>
<li>An update on bug fixes and performance tuning in BBRv3.</li>
<li>Deployment status at Google was discussed.</li>
<li>BBRv3 is open-sourced and plans to merge it into the mainline Linux kernel.</li>
<li>Fixes to bandwidth convergence problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Congestion Control for DCCP:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Existing CCID profiles for DCCP are based on TCP.</li>
<li>Discussion on the potential for adding CCID profiles for Cubic and BBR.</li>
<li>New CCID profiles need to be standard-track, which is a TSBWG matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Congestion Control Using Inbound Telemetry:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A new approach to congestion control using inbound telemetry from network ASICs.</li>
<li>The use of IOAM, INT, and IFA for telemetry was mentioned.</li>
<li>The importance of action time, especially in data center environments, was emphasized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adopt 5033bis:</strong> The working group agreed to adopt the existing 5033bis draft as the starting point for revision.</li>
<li><strong>Remove Authors:</strong> Sally Floyd and Mark Allman will be acknowledged but no longer listed as authors of 5033bis.</li>
<li><strong>BBRv3 in Linux:</strong> Google plans to submit BBRv3 patches for inclusion in the mainline Linux kernel.</li>
<li><strong>DCCP and TSBWG:</strong> Nathalie Romo will need to submit the DCCP CCD profile drafts for review by TSBWG.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Corey and Mathis will continue editing the 5033bis draft.</li>
<li>Attendees are encouraged to review and provide feedback on the 5033bis, BCP41 Update, and Inbound Telemetry drafts on GitHub.</li>
<li>Explore options for new drafts on transport prognostic renal congestion control.</li>
<li>Further discussion on the scope and relationship between 5033bis and a potential update to BCP41.</li>
</ul>
