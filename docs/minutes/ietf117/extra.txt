## Summary
The meeting covered several topics including the status of existing drafts, handling of IRADA reports, and discussion of new extensions. Key areas of discussion included correlation to Apsi, issues related to the message limit extension, and potential new commands and actions like snooze. Decisions were made on how to handle specific IRADA reports.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **IRADA Reports:** Discussion and decisions on how to handle several IRADA reports, including those related to RFC 3501, response texts, and character set support.
*   **Message Limit Extension:** Extensive discussion around the impact of unilaterally enforced message limits on existing clients, the need for separate capabilities for different commands (copy, append, UIDFETCH), and the potential use of the existing "limit" response code.
*   **IMAP Snooze:** Presentation of a proposed IMAP snooze command and discussion of alternative approaches, such as using annotations instead of a dedicated mailbox.
*   **Process Calendar:** Updates to the process calendar draft for non-iTIP messages.
*   **Large Mailboxes:** Discussion about the number of flags used in large mailboxes and potential solutions.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **IRADA 670 (Azure ID):** Held for document update.
*   **IRADA 88 (Trailing Space):** Held for document update. Consider making the space optional in the next revision.
*   **IRADA 7243.46 (Response Offset):** Assigned to Pete Resnick and Barry to review.
*   **IRADA 7323 (UTF-8 Support):** Accept and verify after editing the text to mention UTF-8 not being supported.
*   **IRADA (Nested Sequence Set Identifier):** Review the mailing list discussion to determine the required action.
*   **Message Limit Extension:**
    *   Consider adding text to warn servers about the impact on existing clients.
    *   Explore the possibility of publishing the extension as experimental.
    *   Consider whether to allow expunge operation to return message limit
    *   Consider additional discussion on the mailing list
*   **Process Calendar:** Update the draft with text for the security section (dealing with calendar spam) and then mark it ready for working group last call.
*   **IMAP Snooze:** Take the discussion to the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Address the action items related to the IRADA reports.
*   Continue discussions on the message limit extension and IMAP snooze on the mailing list.
*   Prepare the process calendar draft for working group last call.
