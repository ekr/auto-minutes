# anima Meeting - IETF 117

## Summary

This meeting covered the current status and next steps for several active documents within the anima working group. Key topics included updates on the Brewski suite of drafts (AE, PRM, JWS Voucher), discussion of discovery mechanisms for Brewski variations, and a new proposal for certificate-less enrollment in Brewski. There was also a presentation on ANI auto-configuration via DNS.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Brewski AE, PRM, and JWS Voucher Status:** Updates were presented on each draft, highlighting progress since IETF 116, addressing working group last call feedback, and identifying remaining open issues. The dependency between the drafts was acknowledged.
*   **Brewski Discovery:** A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to discussing discovery mechanisms for Brewski variations. The discussion centered around how a pledge can discover registrars supporting specific features, such as registrar/pledge responder mode, enrollment protocol (EST, CMP), and voucher format (CMS, JWS).
*   **Registry of Brewski Variations:** It was proposed to create an IANA registry for Brewski variations to allow new variations to be added without creating dependencies between different drafts. This registry would define parameters like enrollment mode, enrollment protocol, and voucher format.
*   **ANI Auto-Configuration via DNS:** The need for DNS-free service discovery and selection in autonomic networks was emphasized. The draft proposes expanding GRASP to support service announcements and discovery compatible with DNS-SD. It covered the gaps between DNS-SD and GRASP, and the challenges in deploying services using it.
*   **Certificate-less Enrollment Protocol in Brewski:** A new proposal for a certificate-less enrollment protocol (SA-CLL) for constrained IoT devices was presented. The protocol uses a public key-based credential instead of certificates, which can significantly reduce computational and transmission overhead.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **RFC 8366 Early Review:** Start an early review of RFC 8366.
*   **Brewski PRM Sector Review:**  Initiate a re-review for sector security aspects of the Rusky PRM draft. Request the same reviewer to mark the security review section that the previous issues have been resolved.
*   **IANA Registration for JWS Voucher:**  Initiate the IANA registration process for the type value definition of voucher, JWS Jason.
*   **Brewski Discovery Registry:** Create a separate draft RFC to standardize the registry of Brewski variations (enrollment mode, enrollment protocol, voucher format).
*   **Contact CFRG and ACE Experts:** The authors of the SA-CLL draft are encouraged to engage with the CFRG to validate the security aspects of the proposed cryptographic approach, and the ACE working group to ensure alignment with existing standards.
*   **Open Issues Discussion:** Further discussion to be made on the issues to have clarity.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of Brewski drafts to address remaining open issues and incorporate feedback from working group and early reviews.
*   Continue discussion on the mailing list and in design team meetings regarding the encoding of Brewski variations in GRASP announcements.
*   Develop guidance on the scalability of flooding in large networks for the ANI auto-configuration draft.
*   Progress the new registry draft with the action item above, for Brewski variation discovery.
