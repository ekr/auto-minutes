## Summary

The GROW working group session at IETF 117 in San Francisco covered several drafts related to BGP monitoring and routing operations. Discussions included the BGP Anycast community, updates on the BMP Yang module, splitting the namespace for BNP initiation and propagation messages, the TLV EBIT draft, and the TLV draft including stateless parsing and versioning.  Jeff Haas presented on BGP attribute escape.  Jeff Francois presented an update on the BMP lock peer draft and Maxence Sadie's work on BMP implementation in FRRouting. Decisions were made regarding bumping the BMP version number and adopting the BMP routes event logging draft.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **BGP Anycast Community:** Concerns were raised regarding the clarity of usage and potential abuse of the BGP Anycast community.  The working group was encouraged to provide feedback.
*   **BMP Yang Module:** Camilo Cardona urged attendees to review the updated draft with detailed design choices and examples, soliciting feedback before a potential Yang Doctors review.
*   **BNP Namespace Splitting:** Paolo Lucente presented on splitting the namespace for BNP initiation and propagation messages and reserving unused code points.
*   **TLV EBIT Draft:**  Discussion focused on removing experimental code points and the applicability of EBIT to stats types.
*   **TLV Draft:** Paolo Lucente presented on remaining tasks, including stateless parsing (AdPath flag) and the decision between bumping the BMP version or using a new message type for root monitoring.
*   **BGP Attribute Escape:** Jeff Haas detailed the operational impacts of attribute escape, scoping challenges, and potential mitigations.  He aims to socialize the issue within the operator community.
*   **BMP Lock Peer Draft:** Jeff Francois presented on updating the BMP lock peer draft to include peer address information and VRF context, addressing feedback on updating RC9069 versus using a new TLV. Implementation experiences in FRRouting were discussed.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Bumping BMP Version:**  The working group decided to bump the BMP version number for the TLV draft to signal non-backward compatible changes. Paolo Lucente will send an email to the mailing list to confirm the decision and outline the implications.
*   **BMP Routes Event Logging Adoption:** The working group decided to proceed with a working group call for adoption for the BMP routes event logging draft.
*  **FRRouting + BMP implementation:** Encourage the participation of more people on FRRouting code review.

## Next Steps

*   Paolo Lucente will send an email to the grow mailing list regarding the decision to bump the BMP version.
*   A working group call for adoption will be initiated for the BMP routes event logging draft.
*   Jeff Haas will present on BGP attribute escape at IDR.
*   Camilo Cardona is expecting feedback on the BMP Yang Module.
