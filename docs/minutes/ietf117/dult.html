<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This Birds of a Feather (BoF) session explored the problem of detecting unwanted location trackers and discussed the potential for forming an IETF working group to standardize related protocols. The session included problem statements, presentations on existing systems and threat models, and extensive discussion on the scope of a potential charter. While there was strong interest in addressing the problem space, significant concerns were raised about the initially proposed charter, leading to a consensus that it needed significant revision.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> The misuse of Bluetooth trackers for stalking and abuse presents a serious safety concern. Current solutions are fragmented and lack interoperability.</li>
<li><strong>System Architecture:</strong> Presentations covered the architecture of existing location tracking systems and unwanted tracking detection mechanisms, highlighting key interfaces for standardization.</li>
<li><strong>Threat Model:</strong> Discussion addressed specific scenarios where victims may be unaware of or unable to detect tracking, and proposed mitigations. 3rd party scanners were also mentioned.</li>
<li><strong>Charter Scope:</strong> Extensive debate occurred regarding the appropriate scope of a potential working group, with strong opinions expressed about the inclusion of aspects such as the proprietary blob, third-party tracking networks, attestation, and definitions of what constitutes &quot;malicious&quot; tracking.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Considerations:</strong> The importance of privacy for both targets and owners of trackers was emphasized, with concerns raised about the potential for misuse of pairing registries and serial number broadcasts.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing:</strong> Apple's RAN commitment related to patents essential to the proposed standard was discussed, with some participants advocating for royalty-free licensing terms.</li>
<li><strong>Real world considerations</strong>: The balance between stopping malicious tracking and enabling benign usage of trackers (lost luggage, tracking dementia patients) was discussed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decision:</strong> The initial charter proposal was deemed insufficient and requires substantial revision.</li>
<li><strong>Action Item:</strong> Iterate on the charter proposal to address concerns regarding scope, privacy, and threat model, and to better define the goals and deliverables of a potential working group.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Participants were encouraged to join the mailing list to continue the discussion.</li>
<li>Another BoF session is likely to be held to discuss the revised charter proposal.</li>
</ul>
