<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 25 Jul 2023 00:30</p>
<h1>acme</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This meeting covered the status of several ACME-related drafts, including acme-onion, DNS account challenge, and ARI. Presentations were given on these drafts, as well as on a new proposal for ACME server discovery. Key discussion points included security considerations, client adoption, and potential next steps for each draft.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>DNS Account Challenge:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The draft's use of the KID value to create a unique DNS record lookup key was discussed.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about the complexity of supporting the draft due to the lack of a clear account URI.</li>
<li>Discussion on whether the ACME challenge label should have an added label to the left for easier zone management.</li>
<li>The CA/Browser Forum baseline requirements were discussed in the context of the design.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ARI (ACME Renewal Info):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Significant client adoption was reported, along with an increase in endpoint usage.</li>
<li>Open questions include simplifying the OCSP cert ID, reducing request volume with batch endpoints, and using a single timestamp instead of a renewal window.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Acme-onion:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The draft has been adopted and reference implementations exist.</li>
<li>Discussion on why HTTPS certificates are desired for Tor hidden services.</li>
<li>Security considerations of HTTP-01 challenges over onion services were discussed, specifically regarding potential unexpected properties and malicious exit nodes. It was confirmed that exit nodes are not a factor in hidden services.</li>
<li>Tooling to verify CA implementations was suggested, including test cases with intentionally broken hidden service descriptors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ACME ATo Discovery:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The problem being addressed is to allow domain owners to specify their preferred CA for public domains hosted on public cloud providers.</li>
<li>The draft proposes using CAA records to automate the discovery of the domain owner's preferred CA.</li>
<li>Discussion about DNSSEC and poisoning of DNS requests and CAA records, and what mitigations can be taken.</li>
<li>There was a discussion about whether it is a client or server focused draft.</li>
<li>Debate about Terms of Service, and if an auto discovery tool is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>DTM Node ID Validation Extension:</strong> Contact Brian Sipsa to determine the plan for the draft, which is currently stuck.</li>
<li><strong>Draft Tier Issue:</strong> R. Barnes,  R. Salz, and Roman to talk after the meeting to determine where to go with the drafted tier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>DNS Account Challenge:</strong> Continue discussion with the DNSOP working group and explore potential modifications to the CA/Browser Forum baseline requirements.</li>
<li><strong>ARI:</strong> Address open questions related to OCSP cert ID simplification, batch endpoints, and simplifying renewal logic.</li>
<li><strong>Acme-onion:</strong> Implement the draft in Certbot and gather more feedback from implementers.</li>
<li><strong>ACME ATo Discovery:</strong> Discuss adoption of the draft on the mailing list. Also discuss updated draft objectives and an adoption call on the list.</li>
</ul>
