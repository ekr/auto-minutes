## Summary

The maprg meeting featured six presentations covering topics from Internet scale reverse trace route to web privacy by design. Discussions included technical details, limitations, and potential future work for each presentation. Several speakers addressed questions and comments from the audience.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Internet Scale Reverse Trace Route (Kevin Ramillion):**
    *   Presented refTR 2.0, a system capable of mirroring a large number of reverse paths per day.
    *   Discussed the limitations of reverse trace route and how refTR 2.0 overcomes them using ripe Atlas.
    *   Addressed the use of the record route option and challenges with IPv6.
    *   ECMP was discussed, and how different packet types impact routes.
*   **Web Privacy by Design (Jayshree Gupta):**
    *   Proposed reusing the same underlying quick connection for DNS resolution (DoQ) and web content delivery (H3).
    *   Evaluated the impact of using the same quick connection on network performance for fixed and mobile networks.
    *   There was discussion on whether it was actually DoH3 and not DoQ.
    *   Questions about the practicality of colocating the DNS server and web content were raised.
*   **Cookie Landscape (Ali):**
    *   Presented an automated tool to analyze the cookie banner landscape, but had audio problems and no formal discussion.
*   **User Awareness of Encrypted DNS (Ranya):**
    *   Presented findings on user understanding and awareness of encrypted DNS settings in various browsers.
    *   Discussed the importance of defaults and the influence of naming conventions (e.g., &quot;secure DNS&quot; vs. &quot;DNS over HTTPS&quot;) on user choices.
    *   Addressed recommendations for improving user education and awareness.
*   **IPv6 Prefix Rotation and Geolocation (Rob Beverly):**
    *   Discussed IPv6 prefix rotation and its implications for tracking devices.
    *   Showed the possibility to find physical location data using the wifi of devices found, even those without EUI64.
    *   Highlighted the vulnerability of millions of residential homes exposing their street-level location.
    *   Discussed deprecation of EUI-64. The IETF deprecated the use of EUI64 in Ipv6 address assignation.
*   **Measurement Lab (Leah Olson):**
    *   Presented Measurement Lab's platform, data, and services for Internet measurement.
    *   Proposed opportunities for collaboration between mLab and the Map RG and IETF community.
    *   Data collected includes PCAP data, TCP info, and trace routes.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   Laihi (Leah Olson) to share more information about how to use Measurement Lab data and what kinds of data are available on the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Explore collaboration opportunities between Map RG and mLab.
*   Follow up on open items and action items via the mailing list.
