<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 26 Jul 2023 22:30</p>
<h1>iotops</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The IoT Operations (iotops) working group meeting at IETF 117 covered several key topics including an IoT security survey draft, a comparison of COAP security protocols, device schema extensions to the SCIM model, and a draft proposing certificate-less enrollment protocol for constrained IoT devices (Bruskey CLE). Discussions revolved around the direction and improvement of these drafts, soliciting co-authors and reviewers, and addressing security considerations.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>IoT Security Survey Draft:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Purpose: To map security requirements from existing standards to IETF and related technologies.</li>
<li>Current Status: Covers ALISA baseline and NIST IoT cybersecurity capability core baseline.</li>
<li>Need for co-authors and reviewers due to the expected growth of the document.</li>
<li>Discussion on whether this document should become an RFC or remain a perpetually updated draft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Comparison of COAP Security Protocols:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussion of the progress of the draft, including addressing comments from IETF 116 and early IUT review.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about terminology, key exchange, and security considerations, with plans to address them.</li>
<li>Decision needed on whether to wait for CTLS to be published before moving to working group last call.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Device Schema Extensions to SCIM:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Goal: To abstract onboarding mechanisms and offer a provisioning interface.</li>
<li>The communication reverses, and partners who are providing IoT devices into an enterprise environment will call into SCIM and also link to an ALG.</li>
<li>Updates to the endpoint application schema were discussed.</li>
<li>Open API model provided in the appendix for testing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bruskey CLE (Certificate-Less Enrollment Protocol):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Draft proposes an alternative to certificate-based authentication for constrained IoT devices using certificate-less cryptography.</li>
<li>Discussion about the claimed improvements in computational efficiency and transmission overhead compared to certificate-based methods.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about the reliance on IBC and its scalability and security considerations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>IoT Security Survey Draft:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Seek additional co-authors and reviewers.</li>
<li>Continue development as a draft for now; revisit RFC status later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Comparison of COAP Security Protocols:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sean to address Russ’s comments and submit version 03.</li>
<li>Chairs to check with TLS working group about CTLS publication timeline.</li>
<li>Working group to decide whether to wait for CTLS publication before last call.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Device Schema Extensions to SCIM:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Elliot to correct language clarity issues.</li>
<li>Elliot to correct regex inconsistencies for MAC addresses.</li>
<li>Intend to release LSS code for testing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bruskey CLE:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Author to address concerns raised about IBC and its security implications, especially scalability and potential vulnerabilities with centralized key generation.</li>
<li>Author to clarify comparisons with TLS in later presentations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue development and refinement of all drafts based on feedback.</li>
<li>Seek additional co-authors and reviewers for the IoT security survey.</li>
<li>Address comments and issues raised during the meeting.</li>
<li>Determine a timeline for progressing the COAP security protocols comparison draft to working group last call.</li>
<li>IoT Net is potentially being utilized in Prague, but its status is currently unsupported.</li>
</ul>
