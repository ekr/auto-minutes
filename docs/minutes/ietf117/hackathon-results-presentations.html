## Summary
This session featured presentations from various teams participating in the IETF Hackathon. The presentations covered a wide range of topics, including security, networking, and messaging protocols.  Teams showcased their progress, demonstrated interoperability, and identified areas for further development.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **skit Project:**  Demonstrated successful integration of vendor response forms into software supply chain tooling.  Focus was on splitting application layer concerns from core protocol functionality.
*   **IP Mode Success:**  Presented a 5G-based drone flight safety system, including drone-to-drone communication using lightweight vehicle mobility information exchange.  Future plans include implementing CCM/ECM as ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery options.
*   **Mimi Linearized Matrix:** Showcased interoperability testing between various Matrix implementations and Android Messages in the context of the EU Digital Markets Act. Debated encryption placement within the Mimi architecture.
*   **Slow Open Playground:**  Presented a virtualized network platform for implementing and emulating cell mechanisms. Identified the need for additional mechanisms to solve network gaps.
*   **Yampush Integration in Apache Kafka:**  Described integration of Yampush for network telemetry into Apache Kafka. Challenges identified around resolving complex YANG module dependencies.
*   **DNS Table:**  Discussed DNS out-of-protocol signaling, encrypted DNS server redirection, and updates to an older RFC regarding DNS resolvers in IPv6 environments.  Concluded that caching resolution failures for 5 seconds is too long for some applications.
*   **Matrix Vcon Emitter:** Presented a system for automatically creating VCons from Matrix rooms.  Highlighted the challenges of session management in messaging compared to media types and the potential of AI for VCon processing.
*   **Multipath Quick Interop:** Reported successful interoperability testing of Multipath QUIC with five implementations, discovering and fixing issues in different implementations.
*   **Request OTR Header:** Showcased a demo website implementing the Request OTR header for requesting off-the-record interaction with browsers.
*   **T-Cozy:** Presented updates to the T-Cozy implementation of COSE, including switching from HPKE to ECDH based on customer demand.  Successful interop testing with the causeway working group examples.
*   **Low Latency Crypto:** Presented the &quot;Aryan&quot; low-latency cryptographic algorithm, designed for high security and performance. They successfully integrated encryption to open SSL and found it worth writing an internet draft.
*   **SCHC of IPv6:** Defined a framework for SCHC compression over IP and Ethernet, including a virtual IPv6 header. Results to be presented at the SHAKE working group.
*   **Seabor for DNS:** Implemented a new content format &quot;application/dns-placebo&quot; for smaller DNS messages using CBOR.  Identified issues with the existing draft and the need for dedicated specs for Zulu resource records.
*   **Quick in Space:**  Revisited the possibility of using IP/QUIC in space communications.  Discussed the need to modify QUIC stacks to be suitable for long delays and disrupted communications.
*   **L4S:** Tested very low base RTT connections, focused on fiber networks with edge compute. Extensive testing with iperf2 and RFC2322 was performed.
*   **FRR:** Implemented the &quot;bgp extension for mobile user plane&quot; to signaling mobile information in pgp. Addressed interrupt issues from previous ietf to implement standardization.
*   **TLS Attestation:** Prototype that enhances the TLS 1.3 handshake to allow the two peers to authenticate themselves I'm using remote attestation.
*   **BMP:** Updated the Best Multipath process to be exported by BMP. The selected path is exported by BMP along with Statistics. First implementation of working group drafts.
*   **SRH:** New Wireshark dissector for SRH in IPfix. Updated the IPv6 to dissect new code and merge with data.
*   **Path Tracing:**Implemented and tested path tracing in the open source VPP, added the source node behavior. Implemented API for the source node behavior and built a lab where they tested path tracing end-to-end.
*   **Post-Quantum X.509:** Added PQ algorithm support to existing x509 structures. Tested operating with new drafts mainly in the lamps working group. Started working on Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs).
*   **Opus with Dread:** Implemented rather an application of an already existing graph. Solution supposed by dread deep redundancy.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **PDF Format**:  Reminded presenters to upload presentations in PDF format for compatibility with Meetecho.
*   **Document Code Links**: Charles suggested that when working on the implementation works for drafts, a link to the section can be provided in the drafts.
*   **Only one quick table during Hackathon**: Chair suggested that there should only be one quick related project and that should be the first to come in.

## Next Steps

*   **skit:** Discuss the findings in more length at the working group meeting tomorrow.
*   **Mimi:** Argue for layering proposals in the Mini working group.
*   **SCHC of IPv6:** Present findings to the SHAKE working group during the week.
*   **Post-Quantum X.509:** Continue monthly meetings, plan virtual interim hackathon in September, update compatibility matrix, and integrate wolfSSL code. Will continue to update their work and algorithm based on tweaks.
*   **BMP:** Opening pull request to Routing.
*   **Path Tracing:**ACT Demo to be presented.
