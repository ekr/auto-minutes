## Summary

The IPPM working group meeting covered updates on existing adopted documents, proposed new work, and lightning talks on potential future directions. Key topics included PAM, data integrity for IOAM, encrypted PDM, IOAM YANG, Responsiveness, Quality of Outcome, and Asymmetrical Packets. Several documents are nearing last call, and the group discussed the need for security directorate reviews.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **PAM:** Updates based on reviewer feedback were presented. The draft is considered stable and ready for working group last call.
*   **Data Integrity for IOAM:** The draft has been updated to include header protection, deck support, and an improved security section. A security directorate review will be performed before proceeding to last call.
*   **Encrypted PDM:** Simplifications have been made by removing a field that required real-time decryption. The draft is ready for another security directorate review.
*   **IOAM YANG:** Comments from IETF 116 were addressed. Discussion focused on the scope of configuration and the handling of the IOAM parts option.
*   **Responsiveness:** Implementations have been validated in multiple environments. A minor wording update is needed before initiating a working group last call.
*   **Quality of Outcome:** The proposed metric aims to reflect application quality. There was discussion about the definition of "perfect" latency and the interpretation of the overall score.
*   **Asymmetrical Packets:** The extension to control reflected test packets was presented. A key consideration is how to mitigate risks related to security and congestion, especially when using multicast.
*   **Alternate Marking Deployment:** A framework for deploying alternate marking, focusing on manageability and deployment within a controlled domain.
*   **Hop-by-Hop Measurement for Stamp:** The draft proposes a new TLV for measuring the performance of intermediate nodes in STAMP sessions.
*   **Distributed Flow Parameter in IPv6:** The draft proposes an option of distributed flow environmental the controller
*   **Flow measurement in V Six** The draft proposes The new option to carry flow measurement data

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **PAM:** Start working group last call.
*   **Data Integrity for IOAM:**
    *   Perform security directorate review first.
    *   Kick off last call based on security review results.
*   **Encrypted PDM:** Request security directorate review.
*   **IOAM YANG:** Continue discussion with Greg Mursky and decide on last call after revision.
*   **Responsiveness:** Update draft and then proceed to last call.
*   **Quality of Outcome:** Solicit more discussion on the mailing list and review results.
*   **Asymmetrical Packets:**
    *   Investigate a mitigation strategy with robust solutions that can prevent or at least reduce security risk concerns.
    *   Formal adoption to be decided on later with further discussion and review.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to incorporate feedback from the meeting into updated drafts.
*   Chairs to coordinate security directorate reviews for relevant documents.
*   Working group members to review and provide feedback on drafts, especially those nearing last call or proposed for adoption.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for proposed new work to assess interest and refine proposals.
