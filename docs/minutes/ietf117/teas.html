<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This meeting focused on the status of several working group drafts, including updates on common data types, tunnel modeling, path computation, and MBA network slice service models. Discussions also covered liaison statements, GitHub repository management, and plans for future interims and periodic calls. Several documents were identified as being close to last call, and the meeting included detailed reviews and plans for addressing open issues.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draft Status Review:</strong> A comprehensive overview of the status of all adopted working group drafts was presented. 3 documents are in the public requested state, with two undergoing ISG evaluation.</li>
<li><strong>ACTN neutral network YANG model:</strong> The pre-working group last call API pool is complete and the intention is to start last call next week.</li>
<li><strong>Applicability of ACTN to Network Slicing:</strong>  Confirmed that proposed merges from other documents are not applicable.</li>
<li><strong>GMPLS Controller Interwork:</strong> A new version has been uploaded to address reviewer comments and the reviewer confirmed resolution of the issues.</li>
<li><strong>Network Slicing in IP/MPLS Networks:</strong> Discussion emphasized the need to clarify NRP realization aspects, with a dedicated session planned for the following day to discuss NRP scalability and identify necessary extensions.</li>
<li><strong>Service Function Topology Model:</strong>  No pending issues, and the aim is to line this up for last call in the coming weeks.</li>
<li><strong>Common YANG Data Types:</strong> Resolution of comments from the last call including allowing both RFC 8345 and 8795 identifiers for tunnel topology. Resolved resource completion issues, and aligned batch size with other IETF drafts. Ready for working group last call.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Engineering Tunnels:</strong> Comments from Adrian Farrell and Tom Patch have been addressed and the draft is considered stable and ready for further progression.</li>
<li><strong>Path Computation RPC:</strong> Addressed comments from Drew and Tom Patch. Addressed the comment from Cargo regarding the security and usage of priority. Document is now ready for a second working group last call, dependent on the updates to common YANG data types.</li>
<li><strong>Network Slice MBA:</strong> Discussed incorporating topology in Network Slice NBI. Considering references to topologies to allow addressing connectivity.  Debated different approaches to quality of service (QoS) attributes and integration with cost policy.</li>
<li><strong>Document Author Limit:</strong> The ISG is very strict on documents with more than five authors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>ACTN neutral network YANG model:</strong> Proceed with the last call after the meeting.</li>
<li><strong>GMPLS Controller Interwork:</strong> Wait for feedback from the reviewer after the updated version was submitted.</li>
<li><strong>Common YANG Data Types, Tunnel Modeling, and Path Computation:</strong> Coordinate last calls for these documents due to their dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Network Slice MBA:</strong> Continue the discussion on topology referencing and QoS attributes at the following day's session.</li>
<li><strong>Authors should ensure documents have a maximum of 5 authors</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Address the concerns regarding document author limits</li>
<li>Follow up with reviewers for the GMPLS Controller Interwork document.</li>
<li>Conduct last calls for the ACTN neutral network YANG model.</li>
<li>Hold a session to discuss NRP scalability and extensions.</li>
<li>Continue discussion on network slice MBA topology and QoS attributes in the next session.</li>
</ul>

<li>Optimization mechanisms for both control and data planes were proposed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Network Slice Application in 5G:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mapping IETF network slice models to 3GPP parameters for 5G scenarios.</li>
<li>Examples of CE-based and P-based slice establishment were presented.</li>
