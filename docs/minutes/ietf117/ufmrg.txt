# ufmrg

## Summary

The ufmrg (Usable Formal Methods Research Group) meeting focused on several key topics, including defining sample problems for formal method applications, a presentation on using Isabelle for internet research, and planning for a training session in Prague. The discussion highlighted the need for a range of sample problems with varying complexity and the importance of defining clear questions for each problem. A volunteer was secured to document the dPOP protocol as a sample problem. Gergely presented on Isabelle, discussing its capabilities and limitations for formal verification. Planning for a training session at IETF 118 in Prague was initiated, with a discussion about the level of training (beginner vs. intermediate).

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Sample Problems:**
    *   The group discussed the need for sample problems of varying complexity to help people learn and apply formal methods.
    *   Suggestions for sample problems included: IMAP search, dPOP, HPKE, Quick protocol snippets (packet drops), TCP retransmit timers/slow start, TFTP, TCP Cubic, and SNMP.
    *   Defining the specific questions/properties to be proven for each sample problem is crucial (e.g., for IMAP search, defining what properties to prove).
    *   The goal is not necessarily to find bugs but to improve the usability of formal methods.
    *   One potential target is for a professor to assign the problem to a graduate student.
    *   It would be good if at least one problem is related to cryptography, and another one isn't.
*   **Isabelle Presentation:**
    *   Gergely presented on using Isabelle for internet research, focusing on definitions and modeling.
    *   Isabelle is a software tool that uses formally to basic inferencer.
    *   The presentation included an example of modeling TLS certificates using Isabelle.
    *   Isabelle automatically creates an induction theorem from definitions that can be used to automatically check corner cases in the models
    *   Isabelle can perform code extraction to generate ML, Scala, or Haskell code from a model.
*   **Training Session in Prague (IETF 118):**
    *   Planning for a Sunday training session before IETF 118 in Prague.
    *   A call will be set up with volunteers in the coming weeks to discuss the content and format.
    *   The group needs to decide between beginner-level and intermediate/masterclass level training.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Hannahs volunteered to document the dPOP protocol as a sample problem.
*   **Action Item:**  Chairs to set up a call with training volunteers to plan the Sunday training session before IETF 118.

## Next Steps

*   Hannahs to begin documenting the dPOP protocol as a sample problem.
*   Chairs to organize a call with training volunteers to finalize the plans for the IETF 118 training session and address the beginner vs. intermediate-level content question on the mailing list.
*   Consider defining the properties that are expected to be proven for each of the sample problems.
