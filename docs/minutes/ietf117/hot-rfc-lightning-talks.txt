# Hot RFC Lightning Talks

## Summary
This session featured a series of lightning talks on various topics relevant to the IETF, including domain routing, trusted sensors, platform association avoidance, QUIC in space, IPv6 traffic analysis, SD-WAN path selection, low-latency media streaming, encrypted client hello deployment, and path validation for routing security. Each speaker had a limited time to present their work, followed by applause. Questions were deferred to offline discussions.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Domain Routing and Forwarding for End-to-End QoS (Haiu Song):**
    *   Proposed making domains explicit entities in the network layer (layer 3.5) for end-to-end QoS in 5G and beyond.
    *   Described Domain-Based Routing and Domain-Level Source Routing using a new IPv6 routing header.
    *   Aims to foster a new business model with authority of control for domain owners.
*   **Trusted Sensors for a Greener World (Pascal):**
    *   Presented the concept of trusted sensors with persistent resources for environmental monitoring.
    *   Discussed secure elements and cryptographic resource authorization using TLS.
    *   Showcased a video demonstration of the technology in action.
*   **Essential Calls to Avoid Force to Platform Association (Adrian):**
    *   Addressed the need to intentionally avoid platform association and dominance.
    *   Highlighted the Human Rights Protocol Considerations (HRPC) and its limitations.
    *   Mentioned the Gannet (Grant Negotiation Authorization Protocol) and Beckham protocols as potential solutions.
*   **QUIC in Space (Mark):**
    *   Explored the applicability of QUIC for space communications, which are characterized by long delays and disruptions.
    *   Discussed the benefits of QUIC over TCP in high-latency environments.
    *   Presented initial test results showing QUIC working with simulated space-like delays.
*   **The Gap Between IPv6 User Rate and Traffic Rate (Shipping):**
    *   Noted the increasing IPv6 user adoption but a disproportionately lower IPv6 traffic rate.
    *   Proposed a formula to analyze the correlation between IPv6 user percentage and traffic percentage.
    *   Suggested that higher packet drop rates in IPv6 might be contributing to the traffic gap.
*   **Path Selection in Multi-Tunnel SD-WAN (Artonay):**
    *   Identified the lack of standardization in path selection algorithms for SD-WAN tunnels.
    *   Proposed creating an advertised algorithm to simplify path selection based on network state, vulnerability, time sensitivity, and other factors.
    *   Suggested use cases where specific tunneling approaches may be beneficial.
*   **Alternative Option Low Latency Media Streaming (John):**
    *   Discussed how wireless networks prioritize and drop packets to optimize bandwidth, impacting low-latency media streaming.
    *   Raised concerns about the evolution of media, including AI-generated content, and its impact on transport protocols.
    *   Suggested the need to look at the IP transport to handle the problems associated with the wireless network optimizations.
*   **Encrypted Client Hello Deployment Considerations (Louendra):**
    *   Presented deployment considerations for Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), focusing on the impact of encrypting SNI data.
    *   Highlighted existing uses of SNI data in antivirus software, parental controls, and enterprise firewalls.
    *   Invited collaboration on documenting deployment challenges and potential mitigations.
*   **On Network Path Validation and a Possible Solution (Chianshi):**
    *   Discussed the need for path validation to ensure traffic follows the intended route, complementing control plane security mechanisms.
    *   Proposed a data plane mechanism based on vector commitment to enforce and verify the traffic path.
    *   Presented a use case involving confidential video meetings and the need to prevent traffic detours.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Adrian (Platform Association Avoidance):**  Start a signal group or other forum for discussing intentional design of protocols to prevent platform dominance. Contact Adrian for further details.
*   **Shipping (IPv6 Traffic Analysis):** v6ops to study the gap between IPv6 user rate and traffic rate.

## Next Steps

*   Participants were encouraged to review the presented drafts, contact the speakers, and collaborate on further development.
*   The IETF 117 participant survey includes questions about Huddl RC, and attendees are encouraged to provide feedback.
