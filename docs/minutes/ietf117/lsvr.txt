## Summary

The lsvr working group meeting at IETF 117 covered several key topics including document status updates, a new SD-WAN use case for BGP SPF, and future directions for the working group, including a potential recharter. Discussions focused on the relationship between BGP SPF, BGPLS, and the broader routing landscape, raising questions about functional splits and coordination with other working groups.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Document Status:** Updates were provided on the core protocol specification, applicability statement, BGP LS Yang model, and individual drafts like BGP SPF for SD-WAN and the implementation report.
*   **L3DL Drafts:** The expired L3DL drafts were discussed, with a decision to refresh them and formally include them in a recharter.
*   **BGP SPF for SD-WAN:** A presentation introduced a new use case for BGP SPF in multi-segment SD-WAN, sparking debate on charter relevance and potential implications for the working group's scope.
*   **Yang Model Discussion:** Whether to keep BGP-LS and LS SPF in one Yang document or to split them in two.
*   **Rechartering:** The need to review and potentially revise the working group charter was highlighted, considering L3DL work and the evolving landscape of BGP SPF applications.
*   **Functional Split & Coordination:** A broader discussion ensued regarding the potential for functional splits in LS-related work, specifically the division between IDR and LSVR. Concerns were raised about expertise overlap and the need for strong communication between working groups.
*    **Implementation Spec:** There was general consensus that this document should be adopted into the working group.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Refresh L3DL Drafts:** Randy will refresh the L3DL drafts.
*   **Start Recharter Discussions:** The working group will begin discussions on rechartering, aiming to have a draft proposal ready by the next Prague IETF meeting.
*   **Review BGP SPF Base Spec:** Hangshi will review the BGP SPF base spec to identify areas of leverage and new additions.
*   **Hold Cross-WG Discussion:** Routing ADs and chairs from IDR, LSVR, and potentially TEAS/SPRING will convene to discuss functional splits and coordination strategies for LS-related work.

## Next Steps

*   Authors to submit version 27 of BGP-SPF core protocol specification taking into account comments from Alvaro and other sources
*   Authors to address open issues and AC's comments on the BGP-LS Yang model.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list regarding charter revisions and functional splits.
*   Coordinate a meeting between relevant ADs and WG chairs to discuss functional splits.
