<h1>rtgwg</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This meeting of the Routing Working Group (rtgwg) covered several topics, including signaling in network computing operations, the Dragonfly topology, a routing framework for LEO mega-constellations, the ROSA problem statement, and the SCION control plane. Discussions revolved around the applicability of existing routing protocols to new network architectures, dynamic load balancing, congestion control, and convergence times.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Signaling in Network Computing Operations:</strong> Clarification of differences between CATS and SINK, control plane considerations, and the potential use of Geneva for data centers. Adrian Farrell suggested coordinating with CATS and ALTO on compute metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Dragonfly Topology:</strong> Issues with dynamic load balancing and lack of standardized congestion definitions. Andrew Olson questioned the differences between Dragonfly and RIFF. The possibility of using traffic engineering was raised.</li>
<li><strong>LEO Mega-Constellation Routing:</strong> Challenges of applying traditional routing protocols to highly dynamic satellite networks. Concerns about the relative movements of satellites within the constellation and its effect on area configurations. Tony Lee suggested considering existing IGP area concepts such as OSPF or IS-IS. Suggestions were made to present this work to the TVR and MANE working groups.</li>
<li><strong>ROSA Problem Statement:</strong> Discussion of how ROSA differs from existing technologies like DNS and CATS. Focus on reducing latency and improving update speeds for service name to IP locator mappings.</li>
<li><strong>SCION Control Plane:</strong> Overview of the SCION architecture and its control plane for secure inter-domain routing. Concern was raised about convergence times.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Signaling in Network Computing Operations:</strong> The authors will consider DNC issues and Geneva examples in future drafts. They will coordinate with CATS and ALTO on compute metrics.</li>
<li><strong>LEO Mega-Constellation Routing:</strong> Authors will consult with MANE and TVR working groups regarding the applicability of this work to their charters. They will also investigate alternative solutions based on OSPF and ISIS, and consider the effects of satellite movements within a constellation.</li>
<li><strong>ROSA Problem Statement:</strong> The authors will add more details on how ROSA relates to CATS in future drafts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Authors of various drafts to incorporate feedback received during the meeting.</li>
<li>Continued discussion on the mailing lists for each topic.</li>
<li>Presentations on LEO Mega-Constellation Routing will be scheduled within MANE and TVR WG.</li>
<li>Next rtgwg meeting will be on Friday.</li>
</ul>

<h1>rtgwg</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This RTGWG meeting covered several important topics, including updates on existing drafts nearing working group last call, discussions on SRv6 protection mechanisms, problem statements for network-to-cloud connectivity and application-aware networking (APN), and new draft proposals for multi-segment SD-WAN and transport-aware mobility. The meeting focused on technical details, addressed comments, and discussed next steps for each topic.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>YANG Data Model for QoS:</strong> The YANG data model for QoS is considered ready for working group last call, pending another review by the YANG doctors, particularly Juergen, due to extensive previous comments.</li>
<li><strong>SRv6 + FEC Protection:</strong> The draft is close to a working group last call but needs further review. The question of merging with an existing SR MPLS draft was raised, but the authors of that draft are not in favor.</li>
<li><strong>SRv6 Protection Considerations:</strong> An informational draft on SRv6 protection strategies was presented. Chairs suggested broadening the author base and gathering input from multiple operators before requesting adoption.</li>
<li><strong>Network to Cloud Problem Statement:</strong> The network-to-cloud problem statement draft is nearing readiness but requires further improvements in readability and clarity. Chairs recognized the significant work done in addressing previous comments.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Segment SD-WAN:</strong> A new draft proposing the use of Geneve headers to connect multiple SD-WAN segments was presented. Chairs recommended reaching out to security and WEAREA groups for reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Transport Aware Mobility:</strong> An existing draft extending transport-aware mobility from 5G core networks to IP networks was presented. Comments were made regarding the feasibility of mapping UDP source ranges to identifiers in data networks.</li>
<li><strong>APN Problem Statement:</strong> Updates on the APN problem statement were provided. Chairs reiterated that the focus is on packet treatment, not routing decisions, within the network.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>QoS YANG Model:</strong> Request a new YANG doctors review, specifically including Juergen and Upstart, and then proceed with working group last call.</li>
<li><strong>SRv6 + FEC Protection:</strong> Discuss merging with the SR MPLS document again, and address the concerns related to applicability in certain scenarios raised during the session.</li>
<li><strong>SRv6 Protection Considerations:</strong> Solicit input from a broader range of operators on the draft's content and deployment experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Network to Cloud Problem Statement:</strong> Continue to improve the clarity and readability of the draft based on working group feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Segment SD-WAN:</strong> Reach out to the security and WEAREA working groups for reviews and feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Transport Aware Mobility:</strong> Revise the draft to address the technical feasibility of mapping UDP source ranges to transport network identifiers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mailing list discussions for all topics to continue addressing comments and feedback.</li>
<li>Presentations in other working groups to gather broader input (e.g., security, WEAREA).</li>
<li>Revisions of drafts based on feedback received.</li>
<li>Preparation for further discussions at the upcoming meeting in Prague.</li>
</ul>
