<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 24 Jul 2023 18:30</p>
<h1>rsab</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This meeting covered several important topics including where RSAB keeps its records, changes to the data tracker, and addressing broken links in RFCs. A significant portion of the meeting focused on clarifying the relationship between the RSAB, RSWG, and RFC Production Center, particularly concerning policy decisions and their implementation.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>RSAB Records:</strong> Discussed the location for RSAB records, with a preference for using the data tracker to store decisions and statements. A wiki for internal procedures was considered but ultimately deferred in favor of exploring the data tracker's capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Data Tracker Changes:</strong> The ISG requested a change to the data tracker to require secretariat intervention for new revisions of approved drafts. This was discussed and generally supported.</li>
<li><strong>Policy vs. Operational Issues:</strong> Addressed the difficulties faced by the RPC in distinguishing between policy and operational issues and determining the appropriate venue for resolution. A proposal was made for the RPC to initially consult with the RSAB for guidance on issue routing.</li>
<li><strong>Broken Links in RFCs:</strong> Explored the problem of broken links in older RFCs and potential solutions, including using the Errata system. The discussion focused on prioritizing normative references and automating link replacement where possible.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Experiments:</strong> Stream managers are agreeable on the use of GitHub and potentially using more documents for experimentation so that they can provide more input a particular process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>RSAB Records:</strong> Confirm consensus on the mailing list to use the data tracker for storing decisions and statements.</li>
<li><strong>Data Tracker Changes:</strong> Implement the ISG's requested change to the data tracker, requiring secretariat intervention for new revisions of approved drafts.</li>
<li><strong>Broken Links in RFCs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Alexis to conduct homework about the issue, including identifying the number of broken links in normative references, and explore potential ways to automatically replace broken links.</li>
<li>Alexis to determine how many broken links there are in the IAB stream.</li>
<li>Alexis to talk to rest for research analysis and standards process to determine if there were previously any scripts written to resolve/find broken links.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue the discussion on resolving broken links in RFCs based on findings and further investigation.</li>
<li>Attend and participate in the session that will take place on Thursday concerning new GitHub processes.</li>
</ul>
