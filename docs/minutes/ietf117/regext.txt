## Summary

The regext working group meeting at IETF 117 covered several topics including document status, current work, and potential new work. Discussions focused on the RDAP reverse search capabilities, internationalized email addresses, simple contact vs. JSContact for RDAP, best practices for object deletion in EPP, and a new media type for signaling RDAP extension support. A key decision was made regarding adding rationale to the internationalized email addresses document. The group identified action items related to updating documents and addressing open issues.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RDAP Reverse Search Capabilities:** Status update indicated it's awaiting a revised document from the authors after AD review, prior to IETF last call.
*   **Internationalized Email Addresses:**  Murray raised concerns about the working group's justification for limiting the document to a single email address and excluding EAI-related issues. It was agreed that the document (or Shepherd Writeup) needs to explain the reasoning behind this choice.
*   **Simple Contact vs. JSContact:**  A significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to discussing the merits of Simple Contact versus JSContact for RDAP. Arguments were presented for both sides, with concerns raised about the complexity of JSContact and the need for a more lightweight solution.
*   **Object Deletion in EPP:**  A draft BCP was presented, outlining best practices for object deletion in EPP to avoid domain hijacking. The discussion covered problematic practices and potential improvements including establishing a community sacrificial name server convention.
*   **RDAP Extensions:** A new draft regarding RDAP extensions was presented to improve organization in a coherent document. Areas to improve upon were highlighted.
*   **New Media Type for RDAP Extension Signaling:** Andy presented a proposal for a new media type (ardap+x) to allow clients to signal supported RDAP extensions to servers. A discussion around using the HTTP options method was suggested.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Internationalized Email Addresses:** The authors will add rationale to the document (or Shepherd Writeup) explaining the decision to limit the document to a single email address and not fully support EAI.
*   **OpenID and Redacted Documents:** Chairs to review the existing document shepherd write ups for these documents and move them along.
*   **Document Shepherd Needed:** The draft document regarding adjusting DNS TTLs needs a document shepherd.

## Next Steps

*   Continue the discussion on Simple Contact vs. JSContact on the mailing list.
*   Authors to revise documents and address feedback.
*   The working group should consider a community well understood standard to replace sacrificial domain name servers.
