## Summary

The Privacy Enhancements and Assessments Research Group (pearg) meeting at IETF 117 covered several topics related to privacy on the Internet. Discussions included updates on RFCs published by the group, guidelines for safe internet measurements, data privacy in language models, browser privacy testing, and an analysis of proposed French laws and their impact on internet infrastructure.
