## Summary

The DMM working group meeting covered several key topics related to mobile network architecture, transport slicing, and performance optimization. Presentations included updates on the mobile aware transport network slicing draft, integration of access networks with user plane functions, BGP signaling for 5G UPF, mobile traffic steering, and the impact of UDP checksum calculations. The meeting involved discussions on aligning various standards, gathering consensus for new architectural directions, and identifying areas for future documentation and standardization efforts.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Mobile Aware Transport Network Slicing:** Discussion on aligning the draft with TEAS work and 3GPP specifications, including the implications of removing "mobility aware" from the title and clarifying the mapping mechanism.
*   **Integration of Access Network and UPF (AN/UPF):** Exploration of integrating ANs with UPFs to simplify signaling and optimize the data plane, along with the need for consensus and documentation within the IETF.
*   **BGP Signaling for 5G UPF:**  Potential use of BGP signaling for NUP (integrated access node and UPF) to optimize the data plane without requiring signaling changes, using concepts from the SRv6 MAP architecture. Discussion on whether the role of BGP needs to be more clearly articulated in the draft.
*   **Mobile Traffic Steering:**  Discussion on advanced mobility scenarios and potential areas for documentation or standardization related to end-to-end traffic steering following mobility anchor relocation. Explored potential use of end markers to deal with out-of-order packets.
*   **Impact of UDP Checksum Calculations:** Analysis of the performance impact of UDP checksum calculations on IPv6 GTPU packets, advocating for the use of UDP checksum offload as a default. The discussion considered previous IETF recommendations (RFC 6935, 6936) for zero checksum. Also to consider liaison statement to 3GPP regarding it.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Mobile Aware Transport Network Slicing:**
    *   John to start a thread on the mailing list to discuss changing the title of the draft to be more specific (e.g., UDP source port based mapping).
    *   Request reviews from working group members.
*   **Integration of Access Network and UPF (AN/UPF):**
    *   Discuss with 3GPP liaison regarding the suitability of sending an informational document.
    *   Initiate a mailing list discussion to gather more reviews and feedback.
*   **BGP Signaling for 5G UPF:**
    *   Jeffrey to clarify the role of BGP in the document.
*   **Motivation for SRv6 mUP Draft:**
    *   Mia to request an adoption call after some more reviews.
*   **Mobility Capability Negotiation (MCN) Draft:**
    *   Request and gather feedback on the document.
*   **Impact Analysis of UDP Checksum Calculations:**
    *   Suresh to investigate sending a liaison statement to 3GPP regarding UDP checksum recommendations.
*   **Mobile Traffic Steering:**
    *   Marco to draft a document describing the problem and potential solutions for mobile traffic steering scenarios.

## Next Steps

*   Continue discussions on the mailing list for each topic.
*   Authors to revise their respective drafts based on the feedback received.
*   Schedule adoption calls where appropriate.
*   Consider sending a liaison statement to 3GPP regarding UDP checksums.
*   Identify reviewers for each draft.
