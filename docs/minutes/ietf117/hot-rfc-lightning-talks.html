<p><strong>Session Date/Time:</strong> 24 Jul 2023 01:00</p>
<h1>Hot RFC Lightning Talks</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This session featured a series of lightning talks on various topics relevant to the IETF, including domain routing, trusted sensors, platform association avoidance, QUIC in space, IPv6 traffic analysis, SD-WAN path selection, low-latency media streaming, encrypted client hello deployment, and path validation for routing security. Each speaker had a limited time to present their work, followed by applause. Questions were deferred to offline discussions.</p>
<h2>Key Discussion Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Routing and Forwarding for End-to-End QoS (Haiu Song):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Proposed making domains explicit entities in the network layer (layer 3.5) for end-to-end QoS in 5G and beyond.</li>
<li>Described Domain-Based Routing and Domain-Level Source Routing using a new IPv6 routing header.</li>
<li>Aims to foster a new business model with authority of control for domain owners.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Trusted Sensors for a Greener World (Pascal):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Presented the concept of trusted sensors with persistent resources for environmental monitoring.</li>
<li>Discussed secure elements and cryptographic resource authorization using TLS.</li>
<li>Showcased a video demonstration of the technology in action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Essential Calls to Avoid Force to Platform Association (Adrian):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Addressed the need to intentionally avoid platform association and dominance.</li>
<li>Highlighted the Human Rights Protocol Considerations (HRPC) and its limitations.</li>
<li>Mentioned the Gannet (Grant Negotiation Authorization Protocol) and Beckham protocols as potential solutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>QUIC in Space (Mark):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Explored the applicability of QUIC for space communications, which are characterized by long delays and disruptions.</li>
<li>Discussed the benefits of QUIC over TCP in high-latency environments.</li>
<li>Presented initial test results showing QUIC working with simulated space-like delays.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Gap Between IPv6 User Rate and Traffic Rate (Shipping):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Noted the increasing IPv6 user adoption but a disproportionately lower IPv6 traffic rate.</li>
<li>Proposed a formula to analyze the correlation between IPv6 user percentage and traffic percentage.</li>
<li>Suggested that higher packet drop rates in IPv6 might be contributing to the traffic gap.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Path Selection in Multi-Tunnel SD-WAN (Artonay):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Identified the lack of standardization in path selection algorithms for SD-WAN tunnels.</li>
<li>Proposed creating an advertised algorithm to simplify path selection based on network state, vulnerability, time sensitivity, and other factors.</li>
<li>Suggested use cases where specific tunneling approaches may be beneficial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Option Low Latency Media Streaming (John):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussed how wireless networks prioritize and drop packets to optimize bandwidth, impacting low-latency media streaming.</li>
<li>Raised concerns about the evolution of media, including AI-generated content, and its impact on transport protocols.</li>
<li>Suggested the need to look at the IP transport to handle the problems associated with the wireless network optimizations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Encrypted Client Hello Deployment Considerations (Louendra):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Presented deployment considerations for Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), focusing on the impact of encrypting SNI data.</li>
<li>Highlighted existing uses of SNI data in antivirus software, parental controls, and enterprise firewalls.</li>
<li>Invited collaboration on documenting deployment challenges and potential mitigations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On Network Path Validation and a Possible Solution (Chianshi):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discussed the need for path validation to ensure traffic follows the intended route, complementing control plane security mechanisms.</li>
<li>Proposed a data plane mechanism based on vector commitment to enforce and verify the traffic path.</li>
<li>Presented a use case involving confidential video meetings and the need to prevent traffic detours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions and Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adrian (Platform Association Avoidance):</strong>  Start a signal group or other forum for discussing intentional design of protocols to prevent platform dominance. Contact Adrian for further details.</li>
<li><strong>Shipping (IPv6 Traffic Analysis):</strong> v6ops to study the gap between IPv6 user rate and traffic rate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Participants were encouraged to review the presented drafts, contact the speakers, and collaborate on further development.</li>
<li>The IETF 117 participant survey includes questions about Huddl RC, and attendees are encouraged to provide feedback.</li>
</ul>
