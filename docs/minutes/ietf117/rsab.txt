## Summary

This meeting covered several important topics including where RSAB keeps its records, changes to the data tracker, and addressing broken links in RFCs. A significant portion of the meeting focused on clarifying the relationship between the RSAB, RSWG, and RFC Production Center, particularly concerning policy decisions and their implementation.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **RSAB Records:** Discussed the location for RSAB records, with a preference for using the data tracker to store decisions and statements. A wiki for internal procedures was considered but ultimately deferred in favor of exploring the data tracker's capabilities.
*   **Data Tracker Changes:** The ISG requested a change to the data tracker to require secretariat intervention for new revisions of approved drafts. This was discussed and generally supported.
*   **Policy vs. Operational Issues:** Addressed the difficulties faced by the RPC in distinguishing between policy and operational issues and determining the appropriate venue for resolution. A proposal was made for the RPC to initially consult with the RSAB for guidance on issue routing.
*   **Broken Links in RFCs:** Explored the problem of broken links in older RFCs and potential solutions, including using the Errata system. The discussion focused on prioritizing normative references and automating link replacement where possible.
*   **GitHub Experiments:** Stream managers are agreeable on the use of GitHub and potentially using more documents for experimentation so that they can provide more input a particular process.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **RSAB Records:** Confirm consensus on the mailing list to use the data tracker for storing decisions and statements.
*   **Data Tracker Changes:** Implement the ISG's requested change to the data tracker, requiring secretariat intervention for new revisions of approved drafts.
*   **Broken Links in RFCs:**
    *   Alexis to conduct homework about the issue, including identifying the number of broken links in normative references, and explore potential ways to automatically replace broken links.
    *   Alexis to determine how many broken links there are in the IAB stream.
    *   Alexis to talk to rest for research analysis and standards process to determine if there were previously any scripts written to resolve/find broken links.

## Next Steps

*   Continue the discussion on resolving broken links in RFCs based on findings and further investigation.
*   Attend and participate in the session that will take place on Thursday concerning new GitHub processes.
