## Summary

The TBR working group meeting covered a range of topics including updates on the use cases document, requirements documents, data models for scheduled attributes and link availability, and routing considerations.  Discussions focused on clarifying the scope of TBR, defining key terminology, and merging different data models.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Use Cases Document Update:** Discussion included adding tidal networks and satellite communication scenarios, changing &quot;mobile devices&quot; to &quot;dynamic mobility&quot;, and the need for a problem statement in the document. The inclusion of predictable traffic patterns was debated.
*   **Requirements Documents:** Focus on defining time-variant networks and the distinction between scheduled and wall clock time. The discussion centered on node classification and how schedules interact with unplanned events. The need for the consideration of predictability not coming true was also discussed.
*   **Yang Data Models:** Two data models were presented, one for link availability and another for scheduled attributes. A plan was announced to merge the models into a common core model with extensions for specific use cases.  The importance of using iCalendar for recurrence definition was also mentioned.
*   **Alto Integration:** Discussion about using ALTO's cost calendar feature to expose anticipated topology changes to applications.  The potential to offload processing from network elements was highlighted.
*   **Routing Considerations:** Centralized and distributed implementation modes were compared. A question was raised as to whether specific scenarios are compatible with the existing requirements document.
* Location bound information was identified as a potential factor.

## Decisions and Action Items

    *   Incorporate tidal networks and satellite communication scenarios. (Action: authors)
*   **Yang Data Models:**
    *   Merge the link availability and scheduled attributes data models. (Action: authors)
    *   Use existing Yang Networktopologymodel as a base. (Action: authors)
    *   Investigate the use of iCalendar for recurrence definition. (Action: authors)
*   **Routing Considerations:**
    *   Assess the impact of implementation modes on existing requirement document.(Action: authors)
    * Location bound information to be evaluated. (Action: authors)

## Next Steps

*   Authors of the respective documents to incorporate feedback from the meeting.
*   Continue discussions on the mailing list.
