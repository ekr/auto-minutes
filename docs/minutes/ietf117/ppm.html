## Summary

This PPM working group meeting covered several topics, including updates on DAP and VDAF drafts, a proposal for differential privacy in DAP, discussion on query modes in DAP, and a proposal for report authentication using privacy pass. Key discussions revolved around the scope and implementation details of these proposals, with an emphasis on balancing privacy, utility, and security considerations.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **DAP and VDAF Updates:**
    *   DAP revision 5 introduces the &quot;pingpong&quot; topology, specializing DAP to exactly 2 aggregators (leader and helper), simplifying the protocol, and improving performance.
    *   VDAF revision 6 allows for arbitrary aggregators opening it for other protocols.
    *   Discussion around the new name pingpong topology as it is considered &quot;silly.&quot;
    *   Histogram representation in VDAF now parameterized by the number of buckets for improved efficiency.
*   **Differential Privacy in DAP:**
    *   A proposal was presented for incorporating differential privacy (DP) into DAP to protect individual measurements from being leaked via aggregate results.
    *   Different approaches to adding noise (client-side, aggregator-side, collector-side) and their trade-offs were discussed.
    *   Questions were raised about the appropriate working group for this work (PPM vs. others), with the consensus leaning towards PPM initially.
    *   The scope of the document was debated, including the level of detail for DP mechanisms, integration with DAP/VDAF, and guidance on parameter tuning (e.g., Epsilon and Delta).
    *   The usefulness of local DP was questioned in the context of DAP and how it fits within the system, in contrast to central DP.
    *   The impact of a potentially defecting aggregator in the context of DP was discussed.
*   **DAP Query Modes (Time Interval vs. Fixed Size):**
    *   A discussion was initiated on the two query types currently supported by DAP: time interval and fixed size.
    *   Concerns were raised about the &quot;orphaned reports&quot; problem with the time interval query type.
    *   The potential of a fixed size query with the ability to simulate time intervals was discussed, but challenges related to seasonality were highlighted.
    *   Potential benefits of eliminating the time interval query type, such as a cleaner collection API, were presented.
    *   A hybrid approach, combining arrival time and a &quot;report age&quot; cutoff to alleviate latency issues, was suggested.
    *   The importance of maintaining the ability to run comparative experiments against the same time period with multiple DAP tasks was highlighted.
*   **Report Authentication with Privacy Pass:**
    *   A proposal for an extension to DAP using Privacy Pass tokens to mitigate civil attacks (malicious parties generating a large number of reports) was presented.
    *   The extension involves clients acquiring tokens and attaching them to DAP reports, with aggregators validating the tokens.
    *   The need for the client to synthesize the challenge instead of leader/helper was discussed.
    *   The rationale for not using the standard Privacy Pass HTTP bindings was explored, focusing on the indirect client-helper communication.
    *   Concerns were raised about the threat model assumptions (specifically regarding the trustworthiness of the leader and helper) and the effectiveness of Privacy Pass in this context.
    *   The possibility of re-using tokens across DAP tasks, mainly for privacy pass infrastructure load issues.
    *   Helpers should retrieve the key by fetching from a known directory.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Adopt DP work:** PPM will adopt the work on Differential Privacy for DAP/VDAF.
*   **DP Draft:** Continue working on the differential privacy draft, focusing on algorithm specifications and composition with VDAF. The level of detail for DAP-specific integration remains open.
*   **Investigate Seasonality**: Investigate the challenges of seasonality related to running experiments by the Divvy Up team.
*   **Evaluate Orphaned Reports**: Evaluate how orphaned reports influence DAP by Divvy Up.

## Next Steps

*   The differential privacy draft will continue to be developed, with contributors welcome.
*   Further work will be done to analyze the use cases and concerns around DAP query types, particularly the seasonality issue with fixed-size queries.
*   The report authentication proposal will be further discussed and refined on the GitHub repository.
*   Consider an interim meeting to discuss DAP query types.
