## Summary

This meeting of the LPWAN working group focused on the transition to the SHICK working group, including a review of completed milestones and a discussion of ongoing work items. Topics included OEM work related to ICMP compression, updates to the SHICK for CoAP draft, access control for SHICK rules, and architectural considerations for establishing SHICK sessions over generic networks. Tight ESP compression was also discussed.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **LPWAN to SHICK Transition:** The working group is transitioning from LPWAN to SHICK, with LPWAN concluding after the publication of RFCs 8441 and 8442. The architecture document is moving to SHICK.
*   **OEM Work (ICMP Compression):** Laurent presented on OEM for ICMP compression in constrained environments, including proxy functionality, ICMP generation, and new matching operators. There was a discussion about generating new ICMP codes versus using existing ones, security considerations around exposing LPWAN devices via ICMP, and the possibility of using OEM to assert link quality.
*   **SHICK for CoAP Update (draft-ietf-lpwan-coap-static-context-compression):** Marco presented an update on the draft to update RFC8824. Clarifications were made around CoAP options, the use of SHICK with proxies, and the possibility of making the document a "bis" document.
*   **SHICK Access Control:** Ivan presented on access control for SHICK rules, focusing on adding rights to erase or change data model elements. The discussion included terminology, management structure, a threat model, and possible attack scenarios. The high-level discussion on attack vectors.
*   **SHICK Architecture:** Pascal led a discussion on architectural considerations for SHICK, particularly session establishment over generic networks. This included the concept of a SHICK header, different options for header compression (compressing nothing, compressing everything after, or compressing the SHICK header separately), and considerations for UDP encapsulation to traverse firewalls.  The context of the SHICK session was discussed and the parameters.
*   **Tight ESP Compression:** Daniel presented work on tight ESP compression in the IPSME working group, including the compression of clear text packets before encryption and header compression after encryption. The synchronization of SHICK context using IKEv2 was also highlighted.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **SHICK for CoAP "bis" Document:** The working group agreed to proceed with making the SHICK for CoAP update a "bis" document (updating RFC8824). Marco will merge the existing document and 8824.
*   **Architecture Review:** The participants will review the architecture options, specifically for use cases and network characteristics.
*   **Data Model Discussion:** The participants will address the data model on the mailing lists.

## Next Steps

*   Marco to update the SHICK for CoAP document to reflect the "bis" approach.
*   Participants to continue discussions on the mailing list regarding architecture options, default rule sets, and the SHICK context.
*   Daniel will keep the SHICK working group updated on the progress of the tight ESP compression work in IPSME.
