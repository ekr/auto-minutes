## Summary

The avtcore meeting covered several draft proposals including EBC, v3c, skip, RTP over QUIC, P2P QUIC, HEVC in WebRTC and SFrame. Discussions focused on implementation experience, IPR issues, potential for last call, ISG requirements, and technical details of each draft. Several action items were created to address specific concerns and facilitate further progress.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **EBC:** Discussion centered around an IPR declaration and whether to proceed with the draft. No objections were raised to proceeding.
*   **v3c:** The authors requested to move to last call.
*   **skip:** Authors expressed frustration with the ISG review process, particularly regarding the accessibility of referenced documents and comments that appeared to rehash previously addressed issues. Discussion of IETF policy regarding availability of referenced documents and the possibility of providing a package of related documentation.
*   **RTP over QUIC:** Several aspects discussed including Stop Sending, error codes, and implementation details with the goal of finding a target that does not move too quickly.
*   **P2P QUIC:** Presentation on a P2P QUIC draft, covering ALPN, multiplexing, SDP aspects, and different modes of operation. Concerns were raised about layering and the ALPN. Different modes of operation were discussed.
*   **HEVC in WebRTC:** Discussion on SDP aspects to support HEVC in WebRTC
*   **SFrame:** Consideration for a call for adoption. Concerns were raised about packet size limitations with various payload formats.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **EBC:** Proceed with publication request despite IPR declaration.
*   **v3c:** Proceed to last call.
*   **skip:** Authors to create a package of related documents for the ISG including providing copies of the referenced documents to specified reviewers (Murray and Sarker). Chairs to escalate accessibility issues to bit.
*   **HEVC in WebRTC:** Call for adoption on the mailing list.

## Next Steps

*   Authors of skip, RTP over QUIC, and Peer-to-Peer Quick continue working on open issues and address feedback.
*   Discuss the appropriate venue for P2P QUIC.
*   Authors continue to refine and implement SFrame
