## Summary

The JOSE working group meeting at IETF 117 covered updates on existing drafts, discussion of a new multi-payload JWS option, and a proposal for clarifying algorithm identifiers in JOSE and COSE.  Key discussions revolved around multi-payload handling, potential restructuring of JWP related documents, and the need for more precise algorithm specifications.  The importance of charter maintenance and incorporation of post-quantum considerations was also discussed.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **JSON Web Proof (JWP) Updates:** Editorial cleanups, incorporating BBS signature updates, and programmatic example generation.  Discussion on multi-payload handling and equivalence of JWP work.
*   **JWS Multi Payload Option:** Presentation of a new draft proposal for a multi-payload option in JWS, aiming for reusability and better integration with proof algorithms. This included discussion of backward compatibility, interaction with detached payloads, and potential restructuring of existing JWP related documents. Concerns around overloading JWS and appropriate usage of unencoded payloads were raised.
*   **Algorithm Identifier Proposal:** Mike Jones presented a proposal for registering new, fully specified algorithm identifiers to address the "polymorphic" nature of existing algorithms like EDDSA and ECDSA, which lack complete cryptographic definition.  Discussion included the impact on OAuth, OpenID Connect, WebAuthn, and COSE, and potential solutions for key establishment algorithms.
*   **Charter Maintenance:** Roman raised the issue that the current charter does not explicitly include maintenance activities. Discussion on necessary changes to the charter to allow for maintenance tasks.
*  **Key Formats:** Ori directed the group's attention to recently posted documents discussing the key formats required to express post quantum capabilities.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Multi Payload Option:** David will post a link to the multi payload JWS draft on the mailing list and solicit feedback.
*   **Algorithm Identifier Proposal:** Mike Jones will write a draft based on his presentation and circulate it to the mailing list.
*   **Charter Maintenance:** The chairs will work to update the charter to include maintenance activities.

## Next Steps

*   David to solicit feedback on the multi payload JWS draft. The working group will consider adoption based on mailing list discussion.
*   Mike Jones to write and circulate a draft of the algorithm identifier proposal.
*   Chairs to revise charter to include maintenance activities.
