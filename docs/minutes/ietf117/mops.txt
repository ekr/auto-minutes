## Summary

The MOPs working group meeting covered updates on two key documents: the XR application draft and the Treaty draft. The working group also received an industry update from SVTA. A key action item was identified: the need for a document shepherd for the XR application draft. The meeting concluded with AOB and a reminder to sign in.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **XR Application Draft:** Rehan provided an update, highlighting the removal of ABR algorithm requirements and replacing "expected end to end latency" with "required response time." The draft is currently in working group last call.
*   **Treaty Draft:** Lenny presented a recap of Treaty, its motivation, architecture, and benefits. He highlighted updates including a diagram illustrating the architecture and a section on transport layer differences. Kyle Rose from Akamai provided positive feedback. Eric Vindra asked about testing, and Lenny pointed to menu.3dn.net as an example of a live Treaty network. Kenji from China Mobile raised questions about scalability.
*   **SVTA Update:** Glendy from Comcast/NBCUniversal provided an update on SVTA's activities, including work on multicast, multi-CDN delivery, Quick POC, distributed tracing and DNS and streaming. SVTA will be in Prague ahead of the IETF meeting and will be doing a Video People Interest Group.
*   **Document Shepherd:** A document shepherd is needed to prepare the AR document for submission to the ISG. The chairs solicited volunteers for this role.
*   **IPR Concerns of Akamai:** Addressed under Any Other Business.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Action Item:** Find a volunteer to shepherd the XR application draft through ISG submission.
*   **Action Item:** Remind Warren and Chairs to put mocks and quick on the agenda for Monday, Tuesday.
*   **Decision:** Proceed with working group last call for the XR application draft and Treaty document as soon as possible pending feedback.

## Next Steps
