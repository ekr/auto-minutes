## Summary

The SPRING working group meeting covered several key topics, including compressed SRv6 SID list encoding, BFD for segment routing, enhanced performance measurement using STAMP, SRv6 context indicator SIDs, and SR-based SFC control plane framework. Discussions centered on resolving open issues in existing drafts, clarifying the scope of BFD mechanisms, and exploring new mechanisms for flexible candidate path selection. The chairs emphasized the importance of working group engagement and detailed review of documents before moving forward.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Compressed SRv6 SID List Encoding:** Discussion around resolving open issues and confirming with the list that the resolutions are acceptable. Concerns raised regarding clarity on deploying solutions.
*   **BFD in Segment Routing:** Clarification of what BFD monitors in a segment routing environment (candidate path vs. SR policy). Discussion on applicability of SBFD and BFD with active tails.
*   **Enhanced Performance Measurement using STAMP:** Presentation of enhancements to the loopback mode, leveraging endpoint functions in segment routing for higher scale and faster intervals. Suggestion to merge with an existing SRPM draft.
*   **SBFD Consistency:** Discussion centered on achieving consistency in forward and reverse paths. Concerns about the applicability of UBFD in this scenario.
*   **Color-Aware Routing Intent-Aware Routing:** Update on the problem statement, including multicast requirements and addressing comments from the mailing list. Request to be ready for working group adoption.
*   **Parent SR Policy Group:** Concerns about duplicating RFC 9256 and suggestion it should be informational document.
*   **Flexible Path Selection:** Proposal for a mechanism for flexible candidate path selection based on forwarding quality and resource requirements. Discussion on combining this work with another draft on CP candidate path validity.
*   **SRv6 Context Indicator SIDs:** Introduction of new SRv6 endpoint behaviors for segment routing aware services. Discussion of impact service aware function.
*   **SR MPLS FI Extension:** Extension to protect against midpoint of failure by Popping Node seat of failed node but has requirements. Various nodes in the network can differentiate Between Receiving an unresolvable Sid.
*   **SR-based SFC Control Plane Framework:** Presentation of control plane solutions for SR-based SFC implementation. Call for working group adoption as informational draft.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **Security Analysis of SRv6:** Chairs will select a team to conduct a security analysis of SRv6. Individuals interested in volunteering should email the chairs.
*   **SRv6 Locator in DHCP:** Authors to address issues raised regarding the distribution of SRv6 locator in DHCP.
*   **Segment Routing Header Encapsulation for Alternate Marking:** Document not adopted due to existing DOH option in IPv6.
*   **Compressed SRv6 SID List Encoding:** Working group to review resolution to open issues in the tracker and provide comments.
*   **Enhanced Performance Measurement using STAMP:** Working group to consider merging this draft with the existing SRPM draft.

## Next Steps

*   **Compressed SRv6 SID List Encoding:** Authors to work with chairs to close issues in the tracker, based on working group review.
*   **BFD in Segment Routing & SBFD Consistency:** Continue discussions on the mailing list regarding the scope of BFD mechanisms and SBFD applicability.
*   **General:** Authors to address concerns raised and revise drafts accordingly.
*   **Chairs:** Follow up on the issue of SR policy group and determine if duplicate existing content.
*   **Chairs:** Continue the discussion from the meeting to the mailing list, with a goal of clarifying points and driving consensus.
