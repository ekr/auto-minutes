## Summary

The emu session at IETF 117 covered updates on several drafts: TEAP version 1, Bootstrap TLS (TLS POKE), and EAP-AKA' Prime forward secrecy.  Discussions focused on minor revisions, potential improvements, and readiness for last call.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **TEAP Version 1:**
    *   Updates included more diagrams, better error messages, and identity hints.
    *   Agreement to keep PKCS stuff in the draft.
    *   Discussion on potential issues and configurations.
    *   Consideration of session resumption with ETLS and potential restrictions on cross-resumption between different EAP methods.
*   **Bootstrap TLS (TLS POKE):**
    *   Addressed unnecessary HKDF derivation and cleaned up language.
    *   Discussion on use of `EAP.ARPA` for EAP methods and the need for IAB input.
*   **EAP-AKA' Prime Forward Secrecy:**
    *   Editorial revisions and updates to references.
    *   Explanation of forward secrecy and defenses against pervasive monitoring.
    *   Discussion on the k_anchor key and potential linkability issues and possible solutions like an IOU mechanism.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **TEAP Version 1:**
    *   Address formatting issues.
    *   Double-check session resumption policies.
    *   Issue a new draft and proceed to another last call.
*   **Bootstrap TLS (TLS POKE):**
    *   Chairs will discuss use of `EAP.ARPA` with IAB.
    *   Resolve outstanding IANA request.
    *   Proceed to working group last call.
*   **EAP-AKA' Prime Forward Secrecy:**
    *   Document ramifications of using k_anchor key to transport attributes, leaving protocol as is.
    *   Post question regarding k_anchor on mailing list.
*   **Action:** Ping Yongfred to see if CPUs are interested in a presentation.

## Next Steps

*   TEAP version 1 will address comments and proceed to last call.
*   Bootstrap TLS will seek IAB input and proceed to working group last call.
*   EAP-AKA' Prime Forward Secrecy will document the ramifications of using the k_anchor key and gather more feedback.
