# IETF Plenary

## Summary
The IETF Plenary session included host presentations, reports from the ISG, IAB, IRTF, NomCom, LLC, and Trust, followed by open microphone sessions for the ISG, IAB, and LLC. Key discussions revolved around network security, usability of Internet protocols, diversity and inclusion within the IETF, and the financial sustainability of the organization.

## Key Discussion Points

*   **Network Security:** The host presentation from Nokia emphasized the growing dependence on IP networks and questioned the adequacy of current security measures, particularly regarding surface-to-surface protection against DDoS attacks.
*   **Usability of Internet Protocols:** The presentation also highlighted the importance of making the Internet more usable for a broader audience, emphasizing user-friendly interfaces and programmability.
*   **Meeting Attendance:** The ISG reported lower-than-expected in-person attendance, particularly from the Bay Area, raising concerns about the financial impact on future US-based meetings.
*   **IAB Programs:** The IAB discussed two proposed programs: one focused on identity management and the other on environmental impact.
*   **IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize:** The IRTF announced the recipients of the Applied Networking Research Prize.
*   **NomCom Activities:** The NomCom provided an update on the selection process for IAB members and area directors.
*   **LLC Financial Sustainability:** The LLC discussed long-term financial stability, the goal of a $50 million endowment, and efforts to achieve net-zero IETF operations.
*   **WPA for IETF Network:** The NOC proposed switching from 802.1x to WPA2/WPA3 for the IETF network to improve user experience.
*   **Diversity and Inclusion:** A significant portion of the open microphone session was dedicated to discussing diversity and inclusion within the IETF, with concerns raised about representation in leadership, the impact of virtual vs physical meetings, and the need for more significant financial support and cultural change.

## Decisions and Action Items

*   **ISG to cease reporting COVID cases:** Due to the unreliability of reporting, the ISG and LLC propose discontinuing the reporting of COVID cases at future meetings.
*   **ISG to address appeal on interim meeting statement:** The ISG will address the content of the appeal regarding the ISG statement on interim and in-person meetings, potentially with an alternative remedy.
*   **NOC to send out email for WPA network feedback:** The NOC will send an email to the admin-discuss mailing list soliciting feedback on the proposal to switch from 802.1x to WPA for the IETF network.
*   **Trust to consider licensing for RFC forks:** The IETF Trust agreed to consider loosening the license terms to enable the generation of forks of work done in the IETF. Consultation with ISG, IAB, and the community needed.
*   **ISG to have a community come discussion about document queue:** The ISG will hold a community discussion, probably in a room at the next meeting, to discuss ways to improve the handling of document queue issues.
*   **LLC to investigate financial summary discrepancy:** The LLC will look into the $300,000 discrepancy in expenses on the financial summary and report back.

## Next Steps

*   Community to provide feedback to the NOC on the WPA network proposal via the admin-discuss mailing list.
*   The IETF Trust to initiate a consultation process regarding licensing for RFC forks.
*   ISG to organize a community discussion on document queue management at the next IETF meeting.
*   LLC to investigate the financial summary discrepancy and report findings.
*   The IAB and ISG should consider actions based on discussions on diversity and inclusion.
